How has that not bowled him...? But in the end the single squirted past the keeper takes him to a half-century, overtaking Root on the way END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 misses with a reverse-sweep, hit on the knee roll... not given, but KJP was appealing volubly for this and calls for a review. It was a googly, hit him in line, but I think pitched outside leg. Yep, clear daylight there, and Rob Bailey's decision stands END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 presses out and taps back down the pitch END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pongo!

I think so. Given as runs, which suggests so. Googly, which BATTER didn't pick, and it spun away from the bat as he groped forwards at it. Clear edge on replay, but KJP snatched at it, the ball hit him on the tips of the gloves and spilled away for a quick single towards the gully region END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 brings out the reverse-sweep, nailing it past the man at slip, and beating backward point to his right! Asalanka dived to his right, but it burst through his hands END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 googly, pressed to long-on END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full and straight, BATTER considered the sweep but it was too quick and too full.

END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 skips down the pitch but Binura follows him, cramping him for room as he works a length ball away into the off side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 sprayed down the leg side, and KJP does well to get down to his right to stop it. He looks like he's in some pain too! They're dropping like flies. He's holding his right shoulder and wincing in pain but will soldier on END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 nips in off the seam, BATTER defends into the covers END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 cut away, past backward point for a couple to deep third END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 clipped down to long leg, and they race back for a second. Hasaranga ambles round awkwardly to his right, and it looks like he's done himself some damage too... END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 dabbed down to backward point, where Avishka fields on the bounce. He's clearly struggling with his injury, and Morgan set off straight away when he realised who the fielder was END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angled into the pads, clipped out to deep backward square leg END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball, pressed firmly out to mid-off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pulled firmly on the swivel off the hip, down to long leg END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 steered out to point with an open face END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in on a length, pulled out to deep square END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball, steered to point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 nudged into the leg side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 defended into the off side with a straight bat END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 nips back sharply from a length to hit BATTER on the pad, but short enough with good bounce that there's not even an appeal - sliding down, past the top of leg stump END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 guided down to deep third with an open-faced steer END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 punched out to point on the bounce END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full and angling across him, and BATTER drives straight to short cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 defended into the leg side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 all the way through! Angled across BATTER, who misses out on the cut as it angles across him, past the toe of the bat.

Gets up much more this time, speared in halfway down, and it got big on BATTER He was late on the pull, and it flew up and over the keeper END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pulled firmly off the hip, and Asalanka can't get round to his right to cut it off! Banged in short, but doesn't get up much, and BATTER's timing is spot on END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, pulled out to deep midwicket. Hasaranga fields, and stops them getting back for three END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 hung outside off stump, left alone END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 speared in full on the pads, and flicked down to long leg. Asitha does brilliantly to dive to his right and save two runs. The TV umpire will check this... and it's four! Asitha was over-zealous in his attempts to pick it up and get the throw in, and was still in contact with the rope at the time END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in short, and it flies harmlessly over Root's right shoulder as he pulls out of the hook END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 defended to mid-on END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 flashes at one wide outside off, and just beats that man catching at gully!

BOWLER dug it in, back of a length and up towards his right shoulder. BATTER flapped at the pull, miscuing it down to long leg, and Binura couldn't get there on the bounce, diving forward. Good stop in the end on the half-volley to save the boundary END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 defended from a length, back to the bowler, who fields in his follow-through END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 defended with a straight bat from a length END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, plinked to short midwicket! Slightly too close to Roy's right hip to take on the shot, and he tried to muscle it past Dhananjaya, who was in tight. Not great contact off the bat but still came at him quickly, and DdS threw himself to his right to take an excellent catch! BOWLER stands Afridi-style, with arms outstretched, and BATTER has to drag himself off! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 legbreak this time, pulled out to long-on to retain the strike END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 much cleaner this time! One bounce, lashed over the umpire's head, and over the rope. Full wrong 'un from BOWLER, bit of a half-volley, and BATTER takes a big stride to thump it down the ground END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 skips down the track to drag BOWLER up and over midwicket. Googly, which BATTER didn't seem to pick, but he met the ball on the half-volley and found the gap in the deep END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full on off stump, driven through the off side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 gets down to reverse-lap over KJP's outstretched left hand, as he shuffles across in anticipation. Cut off well by the man running back, just short of the boundary END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 sharply-spun googly, hacked down to long-on END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball coming in, BATTER opens the face on this, guides another single behind point - that's his half-century, acknowledged with a wave of the bat.

SL have their breakthrough, and it's the peroxide leggie with neon boots who does the trick. Pushed through his legspinner a bit quicker, I think, and BATTER swung hard with malice aforethought, only to crash a bottom edge into his off stump! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 very full, YJB nearly yorks himself! Makes room and swings hard, gets a thick inside edge low past the keeper for four! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tossed up and BATTER heaves for the hills... edged on to his pads END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tossed up and flayed through the covers, hard hands and just a single to the sweeper END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in, 83mph/134kph and he gets plenty of height on it, BATTER watches this one through. Good over from BOWLER END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angled in straight and flicked behind square END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 short ball, bit of width and it gets big, sliced off the outside edge down to third man END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tight fourth-stump line, YJB dabs this towards backward point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 dug in short, good bumper outside off and BATTER pulls out of his shot END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball, width on offer but he fails to connect coming across END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 flattish legbreak outside off, YJB makes room and clouts one through point going back END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tossed up full, shows it a straight bat END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tossed up outside off, goes for the reverse again and gets it in front of square END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 big full toss from BOWLER but BATTER was already pre-meditating a reverse-sweep and picked out point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 flatter, maybe a googly or slider, tucked to leg END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pushed through outside off, BATTER carves away behind square, has to hurry for the second END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball, 75mph cutter from BOWLER, this is flicked calmly through backward square leg END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 fired in quick on off stump, punched towards cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 slower ball, does him again...

Asitha has lit YJB's fuse and he explodes into a lofted drive, cleaned out down the ground, and it sails all the way! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 slogged over the leg side, gets a good chunk of Asitha's slower ball. Legcutter, I think.

Slightly overpitched and BATTER is quickly forward to thrash through the line, dispatching the ball with a crack through extra cover. He finally gets one away END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length, going across the right-hander, 83mph/134kph and defended END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tighter line, prodded back down the track END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 crrrrrrrrrrrunched! Checks the hands but still sends it whistling through point, too much width this time and he cashes that cheque END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 scooped off the pads, Chameera can only tip it for four! Binura has fine leg and deep backward square out, but BATTER got it in between them both END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 fullish, beats BATTER on the inside, SL caterwaul out an appeal for lbw...!

Poor ball from BOWLER, full and straight at 87mph/140kph and BATTER just whips the hands through END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tight line just outside off, 86mph, shows it a straight bat in defence END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 good length, 87mph/140kph and this nibbles back off the surface to strike BATTER above the knee roll hanging back END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 rasping square drive, gets a hand on it at backward point, or that was away too! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 smoked through the covers this time! Back-foot punch, looked to be racing away... only for Pathum Nissanka to pull off a brilliant stop on the boundary END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball outside off, BATTER jumps out and throws the hands, phat inside edge through midwicket... runs away to the rope! BATTER lost his shape completely there, but still picked up four END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pitched up and BATTER comes across, pushes along the turf to extra cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 shorter, lets this one go in the channel END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length, 81mph/131kph, angling across the right-hander, BATTER taps it down END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pitched up and this is squeezed out into the leg side for one END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full outside off and BATTER glides out to ping his drive, sends it skimming straight to cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 over the wicket, full length at 82mph/132kph and shaping back, plinked fine of mid-off and there's no run END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 fullish, shaping a touch, 88mph/142kph and YJB steps out to block END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pitched up and driven, not quite timed but he'll pick up three out towards deep extra cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 fuller length, gets BATTER coming forwards, did that hit pad before bat? BOWLER is adamant and KJP calls for a review. Looks like it did brush the knee roll first, but could well be outside the line. Yep, not even umpire's call on impact, so SL lose that one END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 glides to the crease, pitches this up at 87mph/140kph, driven coming forwards but straight to mid-off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 keeps him back, this angles in a touch, BATTER drops the bat and chops into his body END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 touch back of a length on off stump, BATTER shows it a straight bat END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 lands in no-man's-land this time on the pull! Dug in short, hoicked away into the leg side, and plugs behind square, well short of a fielder END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 mid-off is in the game this time, but Chameera clears him! Gets the front leg out the way and cross-bats it just over Root, running back from inside the circle END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 clears long-on! Billings was in the game on the boundary as Chameera gave it a clout down the ground, and got his right hand to it while throwing himself up, but could only tip it over the rope! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 steered to backward point, and they scamper through for one END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, cloths the pull down to long-on END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 flaps at the pull, and Rashid hares in off the fine-leg boundary to take an excellent catch! Nine wickets between England's left-arm opening bowlers. Back of a length, BOWLER shaped to pull, and Rashid ran in, dived forward, and scooped it up just before it bounced END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in short, Chameera backs away shaping to uppercut but can't lay bat on ball END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 backs away, carving a length ball out to deep extra cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 yorker, angled across him, and Binura can't lay bat on ball trying to squeeze it down towards deep third END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in short, and Binura flaps at the pull, failing to get bat on ball END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pulled away, out to deep midwicket. They opt to take on Billings' arm this time, and get back comfortably enough END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 backs away, squeezing a straight, full ball away to point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 another slower ball, cross-batted straight to Morgan at extra cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 yorker towards off stump, dug out for a single to cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 legcutter, wide outside off stump, can't lay bat on ball END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 yorker, hacked out to mid-on via the inside third of the bat. Gave himself room, looking to go through the off side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of the hand slower ball, hacked back to Curran in his follow-through END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 wide outside off, and Binura flashes at the slower ball, chipping it just over Roy's head at backward point! All the luck is falling to Sam rather than Tom. Top-edged, and Roy flung himself back, but couldn't get a finger-tip on it! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, slower ball, inside-edged into the hip and it skews out towards point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tucked away to deep backward square leg END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tucked off the hip down to long leg END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 half an appeal for caught behind, but BATTER decides again the review. Shaped to hit over midwicket, across the line. Ultra-Edge shows no bat involved as it beat the outside edge END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 short ball again, Chameera ducks underneath it END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tight to the stumps, gets a tickle on the pull, and Curran has five! Celebrates with arms outstretched, and throwing his head back, almost relieved as much as anything else. Just a little flick on the pull, and Bairstow took a straightforward catch. Holds up the ball to the crowd, acknowledging the applause. Maiden ODI five-for on his home ground - and maiden international five-for, in fact END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 down the leg side, past the hip, and given wide END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 offcutter, jags in sharply from a length, and Binura defends back down the pitch END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in short, sails over his head, and given as a wide END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 slower ball from wide on the crease which deceives Binura, but his inside-edge will race away for four! Back-of-the-hander, and Binura had no idea where this was going, but gets a slice of luck and picks up four END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 steered to backward point on the bounce from a length END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 defended to short cover, won't take on the single END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 wide on the crease, Fernando gets down on one knee to loft Curran up and over extra cover! Some shot, this! He played a nice cameo in the final T20I at the Ageas, and this is a statement of intent END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 offcutter, into the right-hander, and clipped to midwicket END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 backs away, cutting straight to Sam Curran on the rope! Shanaka was a shot away from his half-century and sat deep in the crease, flaying the short ball away into the off side, but could only pick out Curran on the boundary at cover-point. Willey has his third END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 nips away from the bat, angling across the right-hander from over the wicket. Beats his outside edge END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in, back of a length, and pulled away off the hip. Races away, and beats Root to his right at deep backward square! Nice roll of the wrists, finding the gap between long leg and square leg END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angled across him, clipped out to midwicket again, and again won't take on Billings in the deep END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pulled out to deep midwicket, but won't take on the second run on Billings' throw END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball, pushed down the ground to mid-off to bring up 200. Looked a long way away from 21 for 4! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 comes forward to block Rashid's last ball into the covers END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 nudged into the covers and they set off for a single. Roy's throw to the bowler's end is wild, but it's backed up END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 skips down, and bludgeons Rashid over long-off! Tossed up, shimmied down to the pitch of the ball, and thumped it down the ground for four END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 makes a mess of it while trying to nudge to leg. Skews up towards the vacant short leg area of the pad, and Bairstow comes forward to field on the bounce END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full and straight, worked out to long-on END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 low full toss, swept away behind square to pick up a long-awaited boundary END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 short ball, over the left shoulder. Should be a wide, I reckon, and Shanaka protests. But it's given as a dot, which means Wood finishes with a maiden, and 0 for 35 from his 10 END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 fullish outside off, steered to point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 sharp bounce from back of a length, fenced out to point. 86mph/138kph and Wood hits the deck in his follow-through again. Not sure if he's having a problem with the landing area END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in towards the ribcage, and Karunaratne gets outside the line. He wonders if this should be a wide, but it was tight enough to the leg stump, according to the umpire END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full, angling in towards off stump, driven to mid-off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 slammed into the pitch on a good length, worked to mid-on. 86mph/138kph END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 beaten. Turns away from the outside edge as Shanaka comes forward to defend END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 quicker one, worked out to Willey at deep midwicket, and they scamper back for two END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 sharply-spun legbreak on a length, worked to mid-on END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 worked wristily out to deep midwicket END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 comes down the pitch and thumps a fullish ball back down the ground. Rashid half-stops it with his right hand in his follow-through, saving the boundary as Billings gets round at long-off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full outside off, Shanaka premeditates and sweeps him out to deep backward square END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball, dabbed down to deep third with an open-faced steer END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, squeezed away down to deep third via the outside edge END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 half-volley on off stump, Wood gets down to field in his follow-through END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball on leg stump, tickled down to long leg. 87mph/140kph END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in, back of a length, and defended to square leg while riding the bounce. Billings hares in and throws at the bowler's end, but is comfortably home END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 thick outside edge down to deep third. Fullish length, coming forward to cover off stump END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 googly, crablike defence towards the vacant short-leg region END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full and straight, defended to mid-on. Lone appeal from Bairstow, but I think this missed the boot and hit the toe of the bat END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 glanced into the leg side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 leading edge, which falls just short of Wood at short third. Legbreak, turning away from the bat, as Shanaka looked to work into the leg side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 nudged out into the covers for a scampered single END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full on the pads, clipped to midwicket END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, pulled off the ribcage out to deep backward square. 86mph/138kph END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 cross-batted flash at a wide-ish length ball. No contact. 88mph/142kph END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 wide on the crease, sharp bouncer, and Shanaka sways out the line of it END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 wide on the crease, angled in, and they pinch a single to Moeen's left hand at mid-off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in just short of a length, nudged to short midwicket END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 clipped off the pads, out to square leg END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 punched back to Rashid on the back foot END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 googly, which he doesn't pick, and inside-edges down to fine leg END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full on the pads as Shanaka shimmies down the pitch, whipping wristily out to deep midwicket END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 no real turn, defended back to the bowler END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full and straight, nudged back to Rashid END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball, decent turn away from the pad, and edged past slip's right hand as Karunaratne comes forward to defend.

Misfield by Bairstow on the bounce which costs Curran a maiden END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 short ball, which flies harmlessly over the ducking Karunaratne's left shoulder END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball, defended to short midwicket END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 defended to short midwicket, riding the bounce END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angling in towards off stump, clipped to short midwicket END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 good bounce from a length, as Karunaratne defends towards mid-off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 steered out to point with an open face END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angled across him, and beats Shanaka's outside edge as he has a waft outside off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angled across him, defended back down the pitch END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 holes out to deep square this time! Another wicket off a short ball and DdS falls nine short of a maiden ODI ton. Dug into the pitch by Willey, and Dhananjaya took on the pull shot, but his timing was a long way off. Spooned up via the top edge, and Root shuffled to his right to settle underneath it. Willey gets his second, and the glue holding Sri Lanka together has been dissolved END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angled across him, and this is a touch of class from DdS as he moves into the 90s. Length ball outside off, holding its line, and with short third inside the ring, DdS opens the face and steers it to his left END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in, back of a length, pulled to square leg. BATTER throws at the bowler's end, but Shanaka was comfortably in END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 clouted up and over mid-off for four! Slower ball again, and DdS sits deep in his crease waiting for it out the back of the hand.

Slower ball, which nipped back into the batter END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 over the wicket again, another bumper and this time Shanaka swings at it and misses END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length and tucked of the hip END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 uppercut down to third man! Cleverly done by Dhananjaya, realising that the fielder had just come up into the ring, he rocked back and flicked the wrists to send the bouncer flying towards the rope END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 dug in short at 78mph/126kph, pulled with a roll of the wrists down to fine leg END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 over the wicket, Shanaka happy to tap it away watchfully END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 fired in on the stumps and flicked away END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 round the wicket, short and sliding down the leg side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 good length, defended on off stump END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 fired in straight and worked for one to the leg side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 picks the slower variety and clouts over midwicket! Dhananjaya gets hold of his pull and collects four END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 attempts to heave this leg side, edged on to the thigh pad and it only just clears the bails! Doesn't quite carry to Bairstow, either. Pace on from Curran and it nearly does for Dhananjaya END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 definitely a slower ball this time, angled towards short third man and Dhananjaya is forced to reach for his ground as Wood has a shy END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length outside off, possibly a legcutter and played neatly off the back foot towards third man END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pitched up and driven along the carpet to mid-off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 goes back and across and punches into the covers, Morgan swoops on it END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 fullish, 89mph/143kph and stabbed towards backward point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 dug in short and DdS almost gets into a tangle, pops off the splice and lands safely on the leg side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 short ball, 86mph/138kph, rides the bounce and cocks the front leg, pulled for a single END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 Wood fires this in straight, Dasun blocks coming across his stumps END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 gives this some air, maybe a wrong'un, clipped calmly through the midwicket region END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 floated up on the stumps, nurdled into a gap leg side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tossed up on off stump, Shanaka dances down and drives to long-off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 flighted, makes some room, swatted down the ground to long-on END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tossed up on the pads and again de Silva flicks it fine, this time the fielder drags it in END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full and slightly leg side, Dhananjaya is across, deftly paddles this fine! Beautifully done and it runs away END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tight lines, defended towards point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball wide of the off stump, Shanaka allows this one through END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, 88mph/141kph and de Silva hangs back, flicks it down to fine leg END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 short ball, Shanaka swivels on it and clips one more out to deep midwicket END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, 85mph/137kph and jabbed leg side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 placed for four wide of third man!

Nothing doing END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pushed through on the stumps, tapped leg side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tossed up full and Shanaka is down low to whirl away a sweep shot, into a gap for a couple END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 flighted on off and driven END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 genuine humpty! Walloped over wide long-off... In the slot from Curran and Shanaka just strides out, launches it up and over, front elbow high. Sixy stuff END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 short of a length outside off, steered down towards point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 short outside leg stump, pulled down towards fine leg END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 bit of width and Dhananjaya gets this away through backward point for a couple - brings up his half-century, a very good knock in trying circumstances. Can he lash something together from the flotsam and jetsam of this SL innings? END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pitched up in the channel, nicely steered through cover coming forwards END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 short ball, doesn't get up that high, slapped through square leg END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 nearly foxes him with the googly!

Picks out deep square leg, and that's the recovery stand snuffed out, a fourth for Big Sam. Wanted to hit in front of square, as he did in the previous over, but can only stand and grimace as it lands in the safe hands of BIllings. Don't look back, Hasaranga END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angled across, this is tapped down in front of point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball on middle and leg, Hasaranga opens up to mow across the line... then elects to defend at the last moment END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 goes back and attempts to flick to leg, gets a leading edge END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 flighted, BOWLER looks hit aerially, shout of "caaaatch!" as it heads down towards Billings at long-off. Bounces well short of him END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 quicker ball, chopped square on the off side playing back END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 lobbed up full outside off, Dhananjaya is forward and strokes down to long-off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 comes across and pats this one down END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tossed up on off, driven inside to out through extra cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 fullish length, 77mph/124kph in the channel, opens the face on a drive and picks up one END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 drilled through the covers!

Rob Bailey shakes his head END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 oh dear, Dhanajaya is ball-watching here, nearly a run-out chance! Tucked to mid-on and Hasaranga think he's running to the danger end, so dives full length... but DdS was jogging and Sam Curran spotted the opportunity, only to fire in a wild throw that BATTER couldn't take. de Silva was well out of his ground, and he then clattered into BATTER, losing his bat in the process. Carnage!

Extra bounce from Wood, back of a length at 93mph/149kph. Hasaranga looked to defend off the back foot but was surprised by the bounce, and got a little tickle on it, off the shoulder. Bairstow flung himself at full stretch up and to his right, but it didn't stick! Wood applauds him for the effort END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 wide on the crease, dug into the pitch, and Hasaranga plays at this almost by mistake, having shaped to leave.

SCurran dives to his left on the boundary, and just about manages to cut it off without touching the advertising toblerone END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 ooft, lovely shot through mid-off again. Lovely timing. Straighter this time, past Wood's left hand as he dived in his follow-through, then past Willey's right at mid-off. Compact shot, economy of movement END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 dabbed down to deep third. 90mph/145kph, skiddy length END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, mistimes the pull to mid-on. 89mph/134kph END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in, back of a length, defended off the back foot END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 runs his fingers down the side of the ball, as DDS steers down to deep third to bring up his 1000th ODI run END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 defended firmly, back down the pitch to the bowler. 83mph/133kph END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angling back into the right-hander from a hard length, pressed out to cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 offcutter, angling in from just short of a length.

DDS is enjoying this pull shot today. Back of a length, enough width to free his arms, and clubbed away into the gap END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length outside off, punched towards mid-off via the inside half of the bat.

DDS is frustrated to have missed out on the flick, with fine leg up inside the ring END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 flashed away through cover point! What a shot this is.

Length ball, defended under the eyes with soft hands, into the ground, and it bounces just over the top of off stump! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in halfway down, and nails another pull through straight midwicket! Full-blooded shot, rocking onto the back foot, and DDS has had enough of knocking it around, putting a dent in Curran's figures END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in halfway down, and DDS pulls hard through midwicket for four! 78mph/126kph from Curran, gentle pace, and Dhananjaya latches onto the pull, past the man in tight END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full and angling across Hasaranga, who gets down on one knee and threads this away through the gap in the covers.

Pulled straight to the sub fielder, and SL are in disarray. The first time that BOWLER has dropped short, and Asalanka takes on the pull.

Angling across DDS who is anticipating the nip-backer, but this holds it line and nips away just a touch off the seam, turning him into an 'S' and beating him on the outside edge END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full and straight, and DDS tonks Willey back over his head! Some attacking intent. Cleanly-struck, straight down the ground with a full-blooded drive. Couple of bounces and over the rope END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full and swinging, down the leg side. Good take from Bairstow END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full and swinging into the pads, half-hearted appeal from Willey, but clearly sliding down leg.

Sam Curran is on fire! Sri Lanka in disarray against the moving ball. Full length from over the wicket, moving in sharply. Not much of a shot from Nissanka, who is beaten on the inside edge and looks round to see his stumps rearranged, with middle pegged back. Curran leaps in celebration, and England have three early ones! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 squeezed away down to deep third with an open face END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 hung wide outside off stump, left alone END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full, swinging back into the pads, and clipped away through midwicket. The outfield here is famously quick with so many practice pitches across the square, but Tom Curran does well to scramble after it and claw it back, just inside the rope END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 width outside off, flashed down to deep third on the cut where Rashid fields END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 swinging down the leg side, past the thigh pad END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angled across him, Nissanka defends from a full length towards mid-off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 punched out to cover on the back foot, no swing for BOWLER in this over END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 defended firmly into the covers END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angling across the right-hander, no real movement.

Stinking start for Sri Lanka. Reviewed, but this looked very out to the naked eye. Swinging into the pads from a full length, as Avishka looked to clip out towards square leg. No bat, confirms Ultra-Edge. Only needs to clip leg stump... and is smashing it halfway up. Another review lost, and another Sam Curran wicket in his first over. END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 half-volley outside off, driven through extra cover to get off the mark with a couple END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 big shout for lbw, and this one is given too! Bailey had a think, then put the finger up. Perera reviews. No real movement off the seam, beating him on the inside edge. No foot movement from KJP as he looked to defend. Struck high, above the knee roll. No bat, impact in-line, and hitting the top of middle and leg. KJP is gone, second ball! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 hint of nibble away, defended back to the bowler END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 half-volley, driven back down the pitch and Willey fields in his follow-through END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 nipping in from a length, nudged to square leg END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 big shout for lbw, and up goes Kettleborough's finger! Two noises, and Nissanka reviews Swung back into the pads from a good length. What did it hit first, bat or pad? The noise was very woody, and Ultra-Edge confirms Nissanka inside-edged it into the knee roll. Not out! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angling in, but a bit of a half-volley, and Nissanka creams it through the covers! Great shot. High front elbow, holds the pose in the follow-through. One for the snappers. Sri Lanka up and running END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball, width outside off, and Nissanka punches out to point on the bounce END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angled across him from a length, steered straight to point END1 END2 END3
