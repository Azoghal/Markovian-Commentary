The man on the boundary has to sprint to his right to cut it off END START0 START1 START2 START3 length on the pads , goes back and wrists it through square . END START0 START1 START2 START3 length outside off , goes back and punches through extra cover .

A valiant dive from FIELDER , and a good piece of bodywork to save the boundary as the ball dips in front of him END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length , panned past FIELDER at short cover ! So close , and so nearly wrapping that left hand round it again ! Hit firmly by BATTER , which saved him END START0 START1 START2 START3 attractive tonk off the front foot from BATTER . Ca n't beat the sweeper , but he comes back for two useful runs END START0 START1 START2 START3 on the legs , flicked very fine , FIELDER slides well to keep the ball in play , keeping his limbs away from the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 flogged off a good length , not quite picking the slower ball , long-on is up , so it 's a safe enough shot , plugging over the fielder 's head END START0 START1 START2 START3 flicked out to deep midwicket , and good hustling makes two as FIELDER has to run around to his left hand to field END START0 START1 START2 START3 punched in the air , inches over short cover !

The ball almost seemed to have gone past him before he lets the open face get a tickle on it , beating a diving keeper END START0 START1 START2 START3 worked through the offside and he hares back for a second . Few are quicker than BATTER , but he needed the dive . Appeared to have hit his nose on his helmet in the process END START0 START1 START2 START3 helped down to fine leg . Poor delivery , that , and once more it 's wide enough of fine leg for BATTER to come through END START0 START1 START2 START3 opens the face of the bat slightly and pierces the gap between the in-field and deep cover .

It did . Good work in the end by the long-off fielder with the dive to prevent the boundary . Excellent commitment END START0 START1 START2 START3 paddled around the corner to the man coming around at fine leg END START0 START1 START2 START3 flighted , BATTER gets in a bit of a tangle trying to sweep , just gets some bat on it before it deflects fine off the pads .

Another two for the batsmen END START0 START1 START2 START3 BATTER clears the front leg and heaves this high and mighty into the leg side ... but there 's more elevation than distance , and FIELDER settles under it . He drops it - not that it would have counted - and England sneak back for two END START0 START1 START2 START3 another pie down the leg side , BATTER jumps into position on the pull and just sneaks it past fine leg in the ring . They scamper back for a second run on the throw from deep square END START0 START1 START2 START3 clipped off the hip through square leg for a very sharp two as they take on FIELDER ' arm .

Might have been a premeditated shot if you ask me END START0 START1 START2 START3 fullish , outside off , and he gets down on one knee to paddle sweep to fine leg for a double END START0 START1 START2 START3 full just outside off , and punched with the bat 's open face to cover point .

The man at fine leg is square so has to run to his left to field END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length , steered through gully and down to third man for a sharp two .

'' They hurry through , and make it back for the second END START0 START1 START2 START3 length on fourth stump , tip-and-run into the off side for a single that is never there , but FIELDER 's throw is wide !

END START0 START1 START2 START3 slower ball on the stumps , clipped out to long leg for a quick two END START0 START1 START2 START3 legbreak , whipped to backward square from outside off and they scamper back for the second , despite FIELDER getting round quickly and firing in a throw .

END START0 START1 START2 START3 flat-batted pull , almost a tennis smash as BOWLER hits the deck . Swept up in the deep to complete the over END START0 START1 START2 START3 flicked to the on-side , a dab into space at midwicket and BATTER instantly calls for the second . That 's eight off the over with barely a shot in real anger ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 a round-house pull , connects well to deep midwicket , FIELDER sweeps up and his shy is flat and true to the keeper 's end , but that 's just home with a dive ... good awareness from END START0 START1 START2 START3 slower ball , flapped hard out to the long cover boundary , where FIELDER 's bullet arm dissuades them from coming back for three END START0 START1 START2 START3 banged in short again , well bowled but well enough played , hauled out to the leg side , with enough pace off the ball to force the sweeper to run in from deep .

END START0 START1 START2 START3  END START0 START1 START2 START3 thumped into the covers once more . It 's a duel out there , and though he 's clearly not settled , BATTER does at least have some momentum to his innings END START0 START1 START2 START3 shorter from him to end . Slapped to long-on and BATTER calls BATTER back for another two , and they finish with 302 . That 's an excellent effort given they had the specialist batsmen all gone by the death , and lost the first over off the first two balls . England the happier side going in , but this is a fantastic wicket for batting . We 've got a phenomenal chase coming up . END START0 START1 START2 START3 slower ball , smeared down to cow corner for two . 50 for BATTER , off just 38 .

It was clubbed with some force , and FIELDER got out the dive to cut off the boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 this one 's jabbed down to cow corner , lots of bottom hand in it . FIELDER does well to keep it to two with the dive END START0 START1 START2 START3 another sweep , brings up the fifty stand END START0 START1 START2 START3 a very delicate sweep off the legs , very very fine past the keeper END START0 START1 START2 START3 fenced to the leg side , another poor throw allows the single .

END START0 START1 START2 START3 length outside off , whacked out to long-off END START0 START1 START2 START3 speared in down the leg side , worked out to FIELDER at deep backward square of the hip . He 's slow to get to it , and they sprint back for a second as a fairly limp return throw comes in END START0 START1 START2 START3 guided down to third man for a couple to move into the 90s ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 length outside off , cover-driven elegantly through extra to bring up South Africa 's 200 END START0 START1 START2 START3 leg-sided , that 's a bit of a rubbish ball , though it 's a fine diving stop at backward square END START0 START1 START2 START3 outside off , slapped hard through point . A good diving stop from the substitute END START0 START1 START2 START3 opens the face , a gentle steer to third man , more easy pickings END START0 START1 START2 START3 cracked hard to deep cover , a scything cut at a back-of-a-length delivery END START0 START1 START2 START3 angled into the hip , tucked behind square without much pace , and that 's an instant call for two .
