bouncer outside off , and he sways out of the way . Two dot balls in a row . What alternate dimension is this ? Okay it 's normal business . Poor BOWLER has overstepped and it 's a no-ball plus free hit
back of a length , nipping back in , defended to midwicket via the inside edge
dug in short and he ducks under it
very short bouncer to start , which loops harmlessly over BATTER 's head and is called wide . And the third umpire reckons he overstepped too , so there 's a free hit coming up
he holes out this time ! Soft , soft dismissal . Oh , wait , that 's a big , big no-ball . BATTER survives ! He had chipped that straight to third man where FIELDER took an easy catch , but Australia have a reprieve
thumped into the off side ... a free hit coming up ...
oops , that 's gone wrong ! A full toss completely clears
short , hooked , top-edged , caught at fine leg ! BATTER queries the height , but that was just a well-directed bouncer ... no , it was n't , it 's a no ball ! That 's a ludicrous decision , in all honesty . What 's a bowler to do , especially when BATTER has taken a step down the pitch ?
crikey , that 's gone completely awol ! High , wide and ugly . Free hit coming up
thumped into the off side ... a free hit coming up ...
