through him but he 's unlucky not to get a wicket ! Not only was KOB bamboozled by the googly , even FIELDER did n't have much clue . Spun back in to beat inside edge , leg stump and the keeper . Useful runs
ooft , through FIELDER 's dive at slip and away for four ! Big turn past BATTER 's outside edge , it beats FIELDER to his right and FIELDER ca n't get a hand on it despite throwing himself to his left
big swing from BATTER , big turn from BOWLER , and top-edged between FIELDER and FIELDER ! Given as byes , but I 'm convinced he hit it EDIT : Yep , confirmed by the replay , big edge there
