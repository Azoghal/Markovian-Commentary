back of a length , BATTER makes room for himself and steers down to third on the cut to retain the strike ... hold on , no he does n't , it 's a no-ball ! Big overstep fromtoo short again , but the sweeper is back for this one , another chop into the covers . Uh oh , it 's an overstep , and a free hit
back of a length outside off , slashed to third man
length ball on off stump , shows the full face to push to the left of mid-on . And he 's overstepped for a second time . Not massive , but the heel is past the line when it lands
rolls the wrists on an open-faced drive to deep point , and that 's an overstep according to the third ump , whose job it is to check the front foot now . Free hit coming up
agh , another high full toss , that 'll be a no-ball and maybe the game for Ireland ... BATTER kept his head and swung it away for one into the deep , too
shortish and jabbed down into the leg side ... belatedly called a no-ball by the third umpire , too . More than four outside the circle , is the theory , according to
that 's a no-ball . Finn 's law applies ! He 's knocked the bail over , and they 've got a run down to third man
slapped away to cow corner ... and now BOWLER has overstepped
another high full toss , BATTER does well to shovel it through square - that 's another no-ball
full toss , BATTER pushes out and gets a thick edge into the covers - but called a no-ball on height , though that looked a tad harsh on replay
high full toss , top-edged and taken at third man ! But this is very likely to be a no-ball ... yep , a notch above waist height , I reckon . The umpires agree , and here comes a free hit !
wide line , it 's a no-ball so a free hit coming up ! Slogged through the leg side , one bounce to deep midwicket
short , pulled , gathered at deep midwicket . Oops , a free hit coming up ... that 's not going to help the morale out there ...
shortish on the hip and tucked to midwicket ... but BOWLER had overstepped END
