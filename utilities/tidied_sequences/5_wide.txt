all the way through ! Angled across BATTER , who misses out on the cut as it angles across him , past the toe of the bat . Swings away late , and flies between the wide slip and the diving KJP
way down legside , tried to crank up the pace , 142.4 kph , and that 's too far for FIELDER to reach with his dive to the left . Five wides
again , this is ordinary stuff from BOWLER . Short again , and sails over BATTER 's head , was n't even in the same post code . FIELDER leaps high , but it 's a hopeless cause , and goes to the rope for five wides
whoo-wee , that 's gone wrong ... Swerving down the leg side and FIELDER is left in the dirt , five wides
