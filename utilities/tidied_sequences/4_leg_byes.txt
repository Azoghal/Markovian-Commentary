tickled away off the hip , very fine , and away for a much-needed boundary from England 's point of view . Flicked the thigh pad rather than the bat , according to Mr Robinson
tickled away down to fine leg via the pad , and FIELDER does very well to get back and cut it off ... or does he ? They 'll check this upstairs . Four !
goes wide of the crease and angles it a touch too far in , ends up slanting down leg , and BATTER misses the flick but gets ehough thigh pad on it to send it thudding into the fine leg boundary boards
strays on to the pads , BATTER flicks at it and the ball sneaks past short fine leg and away to the rope - off the thigh pad
free runs as BOWLER 's half-tracker on middle hits his pads and trickles down to the fine-leg fence
BATTER gets pinged on the helmet . That is one heck of a quick bouncer at 91 mph and on target . BATTER moving across to pull but that 's too quick for him . Bangs into the top of the helmet and they 'll actually get four leg-byes for it . BATTER seems fine but the docs will check on him as per protocol . The helmet took the brunt of the impact .
nibbles in from back of a length , and BATTER looks to flick into the leg side . It strikes him on the backside , and runs away fine for four leg byes
climbs into a pull , and I reckon he 's faced that to fine leg ! Yep , through the shot too soon , and wears it on the teeth , like a really badly timed leap for a header to the near corner . The grille does the needful though . On we go
strays down the leg side , and tickled down to fine leg via the pad
strays a touch leg side and BATTER swivels , gets something on the ball to send it fine to the boundary for the first time today
