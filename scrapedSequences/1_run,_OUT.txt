START1 START2 START3 run out at the bowler's end! Much better fielding, this time from Sam Billings who is a notoriously gun outfielder. Pressed into the leg side, towards mid-on, and they immediately set off for two. Billings hares in, picks up, throws at the bowler's end, and the direct hit sees Jayawickrama well short! His second brilliant run-out in as many games. END1 END2 END3START1 START2 START3 very full, dipping into the toes, clipped to deep midwicket... and it's a hopeless run out! Both men are parked at the non-striker's end as the shy comes in. Curran gathers, lobs to Bairstow. Off come the bails, and that is the end of that! Fernando wanted to get his partner back on strike, but Billings was the fielder so BATTER rightly respected his arm... his team-mate just kept coming regardless. And that's just a bit village.
