START0 START1 START2 run out at the bowler's end! Much better fielding, this time from Sam Billings who is a notoriously gun outfielder. Pressed into the leg side, towards mid-on, and they immediately set off for two. Billings hares in, picks up, throws at the bowler's end, and the direct hit sees Jayawickrama well short! His second brilliant run-out in as many games. END
