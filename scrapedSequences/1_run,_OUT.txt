START0 START1 run out at the bowler 's end! Much better fielding , this time from Sam Billings who is a notoriously gun outfielder. Pressed into the leg side , towards mid-on , and they immediately set off for two. Billings hares in , picks up , throws at the bowler 's end , and the direct hit sees Jayawickrama well short! His second brilliant run-out in as many games. ENDSTART0 START1 very full , dipping into the toes , clipped to deep midwicket... and it 's a hopeless run out! Both men are parked at the non-striker 's end as the shy comes in. Curran gathers , lobs to Bairstow. Off come the bails , and that is the end of that! Fernando wanted to get his partner back on strike , but Billings was the fielder so BATTER rightly respected his arm... his team-mate just kept coming regardless. And that 's just a bit village.

ENDSTART0 START1 decent yorker , decent connection , drilled to long-on , Wood gets his World Cup final skates on in an attempt to run back to the danger end , but it 's a brilliant bullet throw from Pandya to the keeper , and he 's short!
