START0 START1 START2 START3 run out at the bowler 's end ! Much better fielding , this time from FIELDER who is a notoriously gun outfielder . Pressed into the leg side , towards mid-on , and they immediately set off for two . FIELDER hares in , picks up , throws at the bowler 's end , and the direct hit sees BATTER well short ! His second brilliant run-out in as many games . ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 very full , dipping into the toes , clipped to deep midwicket ... and it 's a hopeless run out ! Both men are parked at the non-striker 's end as the shy comes in . FIELDER gathers , lobs to FIELDER . Off come the bails , and that is the end of that ! FIELDER wanted to get his partner back on strike , but FIELDER was the fielder so FIELDER rightly respected his arm ... his team-mate just kept coming regardless . And that 's just a bit village .
