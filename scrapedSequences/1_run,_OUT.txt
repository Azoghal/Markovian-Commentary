START0 START1 START2 START3 run out at the bowler 's end ! Much better fielding , this time from FIELDER who is a notoriously gun outfielder . Pressed into the leg side , towards mid-on , and they immediately set off for two . FIELDER hares in , picks up , throws at the bowler 's end , and the direct hit sees BATTER well short ! His second brilliant run-out in as many games . END
