Moeen defends watchfully END START0 START1 START2 angled into the pads from a fullish length, and Moeen is hit on the pad.

Robinson says no! Sri Lanka review without much hesitation. Touch and go on two fronts: did it pitch outside leg stump, and was it too high? Clearly beat him on the inside edge, nipping back in towards the pads. Ball-tracking says... bit of a hold up... here we go: pitched outside leg. Review lost END START0 START1 START2 angled across him again, left alone END START0 START1 START2 angled across him, cut away to backward point on the bounce END START0 START1 START2 angled across him, back of a length.

BATTER trying to pierce the cover ring to no avail just yet END START0 START1 START2 attempted cut once more, can't time the glide into the covers END START0 START1 START2 chopped off the back foot, into the covers END START0 START1 START2 edged and dropped!

END START0 START1 START2 attempted pull, can't time it as the ball is onto him quickly END START0 START1 START2 well bowled, fast and tight to off stump, drawing a sturdy block to the back-of-a-length delivery END START0 START1 START2 firmly into line to defend, another tidy over ticked off END START0 START1 START2 pushed off the front foot into the off side END START0 START1 START2 very full length, and blocked back down the pitch END START0 START1 START2 left alone outside off END START0 START1 START2 a gallop and thwack from BATTER Misses everything, but he fancied a piece of that, back of a length outside off END START0 START1 START2 curling past the outside edge, pushed across the stumps END START0 START1 START2 whipped off the pads to the on-side, can't beat the field END START0 START1 START2 driven off the front foot to mid-off END START0 START1 START2 up on the toes, and punched to cover END START0 START1 START2 high-elbowed push back through the line END START0 START1 START2 fuller length this time, BATTER unleashes the drive, but mid-off pounces END START0 START1 START2 shape back into the left-hander, a bit of nip from back of a length. This has been a good follow-up to the wickets. Asking the right questions and demanding respect END START0 START1 START2 a shimmy out of the crease, but another good-length delivery, dabbed to cover END START0 START1 START2 guided out to point, just back of a length, angled into the off stump END START0 START1 START2 pops off the splice, bending the back on a tight line to the left-hander END START0 START1 START2 over the wicket, blocked on the back foot into the off side END START0 START1 START2 full length, outside off, left well alone END START0 START1 START2 squared up on an off-stump line, patted back down the pitch END START0 START1 START2 leg-stump line, poked to the on-side END START0 START1 START2 very full, and pressed with a kneeling stance to cover END START0 START1 START2 well bowled, right up to the blockhole from over the wicket, and solidly dabbed to point END START0 START1 START2 outside off, no stroke offered END START0 START1 START2 better line and length, and blocked respectfully END START0 START1 START2 better line, just back of a length, squeezed back down the pitch in defence END START0 START1 START2 genuine edge, but falls short of the solitary slip. Up on the toes to block the tight line END START0 START1 START2 tighter line, bit of lift from back of a length, fenced with a hop into the off side END START0 START1 START2 panned hard off the full length, up off the deck and straight back at BOWLER's outstretched hand END START0 START1 START2 nibble back into the pads, too high for the lbw but that's a taxing line, straightening off the pitch on a good length END START0 START1 START2 good length from over the wicket, drawing a high-elbowed stride to the pitch of the ball END START0 START1 START2 advancing to the pitch, can't get it away as square leg gathers. A decent recovery in that over END START0 START1 START2 in between length, just back of a length with a hint of seam movement. Defended END START0 START1 START2 back of a length, inside-edged defence into the pads END START0 START1 START2 length ball on the hip, worked down to long leg but they turn down the single END START0 START1 START2 attempts the dipping slower-ball, but it comes out as a knee-high full toss.

END START0 START1 START2 full, dug out into the off side END START0 START1 START2 pressed to point with an open face END START0 START1 START2 fullish on the pads, half-hearted appeal from bowler and keeper, but pitched outside leg stump. Or did it? Morgan reviews. Don't think there was any bat on it, and it hit him on the knee roll so height shouldn't be an issue. Ooh, hold on, there's a little tickle on the inside edge! BATTER survives. END START0 START1 START2 defended to short cover END START0 START1 START2 inside-edged into the pad, Bairstow appeals but BOWLER doesn't bother. Looked a touch high, too END START0 START1 START2 back of a length, 89mph/144kph, and Chameera draws the hands inside the line END START0 START1 START2 banged in short, and BATTER fends it away towards square leg, taking his bottom hand off the glove, suggesting it might have been hit END START0 START1 START2 ...and slip puts down the catch! Root is the man there, diving to his right. Loose waft from BATTER, no foot movement, playing away from his body.

Blocked END START0 START1 START2 squeezed off a tight line and good length, down into the crease END START0 START1 START2 on the back foot, pressed back down the pitch END START0 START1 START2 googly, zips into the pads but turning down as BATTER closes his bat on it in the nick of time END START0 START1 START2 chopped off the back foot out to cover END START0 START1 START2 pops from a good length once more, Curran's finding awkward lift at times on off stump END START0 START1 START2 up on the toes, jabbed down to backward point END START0 START1 START2 zip and bounce, this one explodes away from the right-hander, sticking to over the wicket to mix up the angles END START0 START1 START2 tapped to the leg side END START0 START1 START2  END START0 START1 START2 round the wicket, and poked with a full face into the covers. That's a fine over END START0 START1 START2 firmly forward, head over the ball END START0 START1 START2 dip and wobble on a beautiful length, BATTER can't lay a bat on it as that squeaks past the top of off! END START0 START1 START2 zinger! Outside off, holding its line on a perfect length, and taking advantage of some tentative footwork to burst past the edge END START0 START1 START2 clobbered on the bicep by Curran! He's not express, but he's getting some very awkward lift from a good length, and that's right on the fleshy part, scrambled seam biting the pitch and launching as BATTER gets in a tangle END START0 START1 START2 full-length legbreak, zippy pace, chopped to gully END START0 START1 START2 banged in short, lifts past the upraised bat as BATTER opts out of an uppercut END START0 START1 START2 round the wicket again, nip away from the right-hander, on a full length, poked to point END START0 START1 START2 nip from a full length, from over the wicket, that tucks BATTER up as he hops back into his crease, wearing that on the fingers, and the physio is out to assess the damage END START0 START1 START2 tidy finish to the over, another googly, just back of a length, and dabbed with the turn to midwicket END START0 START1 START2 googly to the well-set BATTER, nudged into the covers END START0 START1 START2 every one a coconut in that over, BATTER can only hop into line on off stump and press a defensive block to cover END START0 START1 START2 this is hustly, bustly pace from BOWLER, back of a length, wide on the crease, angle into the right-hander and sharp lift through to the keeper END START0 START1 START2 beaten once more, whistling through to the keeper from a good length END START0 START1 START2 sharp pace once again, 90mph as BATTER jabs and misses outside off END START0 START1 START2 wheels outside off, just back of a length with zippy seam movement.

Defended firmly. 90mph/145kph END START0 START1 START2 angled across him, punched to point END START0 START1 START2 loose waft outside off as Curran finds some extra bounce from just short of a length. Can't lay bat on ball END START0 START1 START2 beauty! How did that not clip off stump?! BATTER played all round this. Round the wicket, sharp movement off the seam to take it away from the bat as he looks to work to leg, and just misses the top of off END START0 START1 START2 wide on the crease again, drags his length back. 91mph/146kph, and BATTER sways inside the line END START0 START1 START2 wide on the crease, skiddy length, steered to backward point END START0 START1 START2 banged in halfway down, pressed out to cover on the back foot. 89mph/144kph END START0 START1 START2 angling in from a length, inside-edged towards mid-on END START0 START1 START2 back of a length, BATTER rides the bounce and defends.

"Sliding" was Bairstow's verdict on the stump mic. And on replay, I reckon that's a good call.
