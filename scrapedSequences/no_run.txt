BOWLER is adamant and KJP calls for a review. Looks like it did brush the knee roll first, but could well be outside the line. Yep, not even umpire's call on impact, so SL lose that one END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 glides to the crease, pitches this up at 87mph/140kph, driven coming forwards but straight to mid-off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 keeps him back, this angles in a touch, BATTER drops the bat and chops into his body END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 touch back of a length on off stump, BATTER shows it a straight bat END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in short, BATTER backs away shaping to uppercut but can't lay bat on ball END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 yorker, angled across him, and Binura can't lay bat on ball trying to squeeze it down towards deep third END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in short, and Binura flaps at the pull, failing to get bat on ball END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 another slower ball, cross-batted straight to Morgan at extra cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 legcutter, wide outside off stump, can't lay bat on ball END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of the hand slower ball, hacked back to Curran in his follow-through END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, slower ball, inside-edged into the hip and it skews out towards point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 half an appeal for caught behind, but Morgan decides again the review. Shaped to hit over midwicket, across the line. Ultra-Edge shows no bat involved as it beat the outside edge END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 short ball again, BATTER ducks underneath it END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 offcutter, jags in sharply from a length, and Binura defends back down the pitch END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 steered to backward point on the bounce from a length END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 defended to short cover, won't take on the single END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 nips away from the bat, angling across the right-hander from over the wicket.

Skews up towards the vacant short leg area of the pad, and Bairstow comes forward to field on the bounce END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 short ball, over the left shoulder. Should be a wide, I reckon, and Shanaka protests.

Not sure if he's having a problem with the landing area END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in towards the ribcage, and BATTER gets outside the line. He wonders if this should be a wide, but it was tight enough to the leg stump, according to the umpire END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full, angling in towards off stump, driven to mid-off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 slammed into the pitch on a good length, worked to mid-on. 86mph/138kph END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 beaten. Turns away from the outside edge as BATTER comes forward to defend END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 half-volley on off stump, BOWLER gets down to field in his follow-through END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 googly, crablike defence towards the vacant short-leg region END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full and straight, defended to mid-on. Lone appeal from Bairstow, but I think this missed the boot and hit the toe of the bat END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 leading edge, which falls just short of Wood at short third. Legbreak, turning away from the bat, as BATTER looked to work into the leg side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 cross-batted flash at a wide-ish length ball.

He swings at thin air, and Bairstow takes it cleanly END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angling into the right-hander, who dabs down to backward point. Slower ball, which nipped back into the batter END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 over the wicket again, another bumper and this time BATTER swings at it and misses END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 good length, defended on off stump END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 attempts to heave this leg side, edged on to the thigh pad and it only just clears the bails! Doesn't quite carry to Bairstow, either. Pace on from Curran and it nearly does for BATTER END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 definitely a slower ball this time, angled towards short third man and BATTER is forced to reach for his ground as Wood has a shy END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pitched up and driven along the carpet to mid-off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 goes back and across and punches into the covers, Morgan swoops on it END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 fullish, 89mph/143kph and stabbed towards backward point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 dug in short and DdS almost gets into a tangle, pops off the splice and lands safely on the leg side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 BOWLER fires this in straight, Dasun blocks coming across his stumps END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tight lines, defended towards point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball wide of the off stump, BATTER allows this one through END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 dragged down slightly and BATTER swipes hard across the line, picks out mid-on END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tossed up and patted away in front of the stumps END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 flighted, spins into the pads as BATTER comes down, YJB blurts an exploratory appeal.
