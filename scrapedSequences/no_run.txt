Gets on top of the bounce and chops it down to backward point END START0 START1 START2 START3 ooh . Goes wide of the crease , angles it into the corridor , hits a good length hard , and gets it to straighten . The angle forces BATTER to play a defensive shot , and the movement beats his outside edge END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length , angling across and then seaming away further after pitching on or around off stump .

Judges it well from his perch almost outside off stump , and leaves it alone END START0 START1 START2 START3 big shuffle across again and BOWLER attacks his stumps . Brings his bat down at an angle to clip to midwicket END START0 START1 START2 START3 fullish outside off , and BATTER , batting outside his crease and getting a long way forward and across , defends into the covers END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length in the corridor and it leaps up off the pitch while leaving the right-hander . Half-plays , half-leaves , and does n't get his bat anywhere near it END START0 START1 START2 START3 ooh . Fullish , and it seems to swing in late towards off stump before pitching and seaming the other way . Unplayable . Looks to drive down the ground and it zips past his outside edge END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length , straightening towards off stump , punched towards mid-off , who sprints quickly forward to deny the single END START0 START1 START2 START3 shortish ball rising high over off stump , straightening a touch on BATTER .

Definite offcutter action as he delivered it , landing it quite full outside off stump and tempting BATTER to drive .

Misses the flick and is hit on the pad END START0 START1 START2 START3 length ball angling across to off stump , straightens a touch . Shows the full face and defends it back to the bowler END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length on leg stump , a bit of extra bounce .

END START0 START1 START2 START3 solid in defence as the ball bites the deck and seams into a firm block END START0 START1 START2 START3 a wild wipe , and no idea how that missed !

Wobbles in the air , deviates ever so slightly off the pitch and is a whisker away from taking the outside edge END START0 START1 START2 START3 wicket-to-wicket delivery , and BATTER defends END START0 START1 START2 START3 driven to cover . That was a half-volley , there to be dispatched END START0 START1 START2 START3 front foot punch to mid-off . Again , it 's straight to him , so he 's never getting a run with that shot END START0 START1 START2 START3 defended this time END START0 START1 START2 START3 bit of intent from Imam , for a change . Tried to pull it over midwicket , but went through that shot a bit early . Gets a leading edge onto it and it goes nowhere , really END START0 START1 START2 START3 swung . Swung way after Imam had let it go , which meant the only person it created problems for was the keeper . FIELDER did fantastically well to get an outstretched left paw on it , though END START0 START1 START2 START3 gets in line behind it and blocks END START0 START1 START2 START3 drags this down slightly END START0 START1 START2 START3 driven crisply to mid-on .

He defends once more END START0 START1 START2 START3 another one he lets go now .

Watches it go past END START0 START1 START2 START3 no real timing on that punch to extra cover END START0 START1 START2 START3 watches this one go by to the keeper END START0 START1 START2 START3 clipped to mid-on END START0 START1 START2 START3 thick edge to backward point . No run off the bat for 14 deliveries now END START0 START1 START2 START3 another exaggerated forward defensive shot . Getting repetitive , this . I could just start copy and pasting END START0 START1 START2 START3 length ball , blocked to mid-on END START0 START1 START2 START3 shoulders arms . BATTER yet to get off the mark after eight deliveries END START0 START1 START2 START3 yorker at 86mph from BOWLER . BATTER digs it out and tries to get off strike , but no way was Imam running to the danger end there . Wisely this time , I should add END START0 START1 START2 START3 slightly too full and it 's another drive to the mid-on fielder END START0 START1 START2 START3 driven down to mid-on END START0 START1 START2 START3 banged in once more , and it 's blocked END START0 START1 START2 START3 short , defended to the offside END START0 START1 START2 START3 driven to mid-off , and that 's the over END START0 START1 START2 START3 another block . Tidy bowling , but then again , Pakistan are allowing England to be just tidy and get away with it END START0 START1 START2 START3 lets this one go , too . 4 boundaries , one single and 13 dot balls for Imam at present . Simply not good enough END START0 START1 START2 START3 angling away from him , and Imam shoulders arms END START0 START1 START2 START3 worked into the onside END START0 START1 START2 START3 smartly defended . England having the better of this for now END START0 START1 START2 START3  END START0 START1 START2 START3 the solid defensive shot looks lovely , but you do n't get many runs for that ! Pakistan still dealing in staccato boundaries for their runs END START0 START1 START2 START3 defended to short midwicket END START0 START1 START2 START3 runs it down to mid-off and canters down for a single , which Imam turns down rather late , and somewhat inexplicably . There was definitely a run there , and FIELDER misfielding it made Imam refusing it even stranger END START0 START1 START2 START3 rounds out the over with yet another dot ball END START0 START1 START2 START3 gets in line and plays a solid forward defensive shot END START0 START1 START2 START3 nipped away from the bat , takes a thick outside edge END START0 START1 START2 START3 worked into the onside , where square leg cuts it off END START0 START1 START2 START3 rapped on the pads , but it 's always going down leg side END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length delivery , poked into the offside END START0 START1 START2 START3 leans into a drive to mid-off END START0 START1 START2 START3 blocked but set off for a run that never was there . Imam sends him back after he 's about a third of the way through his run , and wisely so END START0 START1 START2 START3 gets in line and blocks to round out a tidy over END START0 START1 START2 START3 driven to mid-off END START0 START1 START2 START3 defended to the onside END START0 START1 START2 START3 tried to clip it to square leg , hits him on the pad END START0 START1 START2 START3 opens up his body , drives to cover END START0 START1 START2 START3 straight , arrowing into the pads . Huge appeal from BOWLER but FIELDER is n't keen . Might have been an inside edge , Either way , intriguing first over comes to an end END START0 START1 START2 START3 banged in and he decided not to play at this one END START0 START1 START2 START3 even better . This one wobbled milliletres from Imam 's outside edge ; he was beaten all ends up . END START0 START1 START2 START3 wonderful comeback .

Immaculate line and length from BOWLER , BATTER is cramped for room while shaping to drive and it flies past the shoulder of the bat END START0 START1 START2 START3 length on sixth stump , BATTER gets across to work towards midwicket END START0 START1 START2 START3 length on fifth stump at 88mph/141kph , nudged to short cover END START0 START1 START2 START3 slightly overpitched on fourth stump , BATTER drives down the ground with a straight bat but ca n't beat mid-on END START0 START1 START2 START3 length on fourth stump , BATTER defends to short cover on the bounce END START0 START1 START2 START3 length on off stump , defended back to the bowler END START0 START1 START2 START3 length outside off , checked drive out to mid-off END START0 START1 START2 START3 length in the channel , nudged to FIELDER at point END START0 START1 START2 START3 nips in from a length , clipped to square leg END START0 START1 START2 START3 very full on off stump at 88mph/142kph , BATTER digs it out , straight to short midwicket on the bounce END START0 START1 START2 START3 length on off stump , nudged to short midwicket END START0 START1 START2 START3 length ball outside off , BATTER has a flirt but ca n't lay bat on it END START0 START1 START2 START3 fuller on leg stump , clipped to mid-on by END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length , nudged towards mid-off with a straight bat END START0 START1 START2 START3 slightly full of a length on fourth stump , nudged to short cover END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length , more width outside off , and BATTER bottom-edges the cut through to FIELDER on the bounce END START0 START1 START2 START3 bit of width outside off , BATTER swings and misses again ! Shaped for a wristy cut but lost his shape and was late on the shot END START0 START1 START2 START3 banged in , back of a length at 88mph/142kph , and steered into the off side END START0 START1 START2 START3 outswinger on a length , left alone END START0 START1 START2 START3 length ball on fifth stump , beats BATTER 's dangled bat . No real foot movement ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 well bowled , BATTER made room , BOWLER dangled it just inside the tramline , and he ca n't make contact ! Precious dot ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 thumped on the wrist as BATTER limboes into the short ball ! Trying to make room but that just followed him ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 full length , wide line , slower ball . A bit of a windy woof of a drive , makes no contact END START0 START1 START2 START3 round the wicket , an optimistic appeal as BATTER flicks down the leg side , but that 's pad through to the keeper . Another dot though ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 hitting the deck hard outside off , and dying off the pitch as BATTER swings into an air-pull END START0 START1 START2 START3 this is good from BOWLER , Pinning BATTER to the crease with inswinging yorkers . He connected well , but predictably , straight to short cover END START0 START1 START2 START3 blockhole ball , much better length , right up to the toes , and BATTER ca n't create any pace on the ball END START0 START1 START2 START3 whoosh ! Loose from BATTER , throwing the bat through the line , and missing it entirely . Length and pace from BOWLER . But through him too soon END START0 START1 START2 START3 fizzed through outside off , BATTER is slashing hard on the back foot but ca n't connect END START0 START1 START2 START3 rolls the fingers again , but it 's a wide line and BATTER slashes at it hard ... and straight to backward point . A loud groan of annoyance ... a precious dot to close out the over END START0 START1 START2 START3 cutter , full length , tight line , solid in defence to mid-off END START0 START1 START2 START3 round the wicket , cramped on the legs , ca n't work the angle off the pads END START0 START1 START2 START3 hits the bat hard , as a pushed prod flies in the air and just short of mid-off END START0 START1 START2 START3 worked to the on-side , hopping into line END START0 START1 START2 START3 good pace and carry from BOWLER , lifting outside off and through to the keeper END START0 START1 START2 START3 good ball , right up to the bat , dipping under a wild slog , and turning past the off stump END START0 START1 START2 START3 attempted reverse paddle , misses the wide legbreak as he does so END START0 START1 START2 START3 fast once more , fired down the leg side , there 's a definite noise as it goes by but England agree with the umpire , that 's flicked the pad . A dot at least , rather than a wide . END START0 START1 START2 START3  END START0 START1 START2 START3 another slower ball , stabbed to point off the back foot , that 's an excellent over in the circumstances , as FIELDER turns to his Mr Reliable to wrest back control . Just two runs there END START0 START1 START2 START3 lovely ball , a cutter , full length , tight line , zipping off the deck and past the outside edge . Beaten END START0 START1 START2 START3 full-faced defence , right back down the line of the ball . Solid END START0 START1 START2 START3 poked off the back foot in defence END START0 START1 START2 START3 defended on the back foot , BOWLER probing a full length END START0 START1 START2 START3 good finish to the over , full length again , attacking off stump , defiantly blocked on the back foot . Just the four from the over to restore some control . England rather need a wicket END START0 START1 START2 START3 tight line , solid defence on the back foot . Very full length tailing into the pads and blocked , a hint of reverse maybe ? END START0 START1 START2 START3 BATTER tries an immense reverse sweep , making a mess of it and collapsing to the floor . England appeal , and upon being denied , review . It strikes him on the arm , but may have taken the glove band on the way . Umpire thinks so , and gives it not out END START0 START1 START2 START3 goes for an almighty heave over extra cover but misses completely . FIELDER fails to gather , but BATTER had his foot inside END START0 START1 START2 START3 poking away at that nearly brought the outside edge END START0 START1 START2 START3 driven to mid-off END START0 START1 START2 START3 defended to the onside END START0 START1 START2 START3 angling across from over the wicket . Punched down to mid-off END START0 START1 START2 START3 starved him of room and BATTER tries to chop it down to third man , almost chops it onto the stumps END START0 START1 START2 START3 pushes him onto the back foot . Good pace and carry END START0 START1 START2 START3 slightly short , and BATTER is incensed he did n't punish it END START0 START1 START2 START3 driven to short extra cover END START0 START1 START2 START3 dragged down legside , England appealed to no avail . But it 's not given wide , so that 's what they might have wanted after all END START0 START1 START2 START3 knocked away to backward point , but no run to be had . Another solid start to the over from END START0 START1 START2 START3 fuller this time , driven straight back to him END START0 START1 START2 START3 good length at pace , poked into the onside END START0 START1 START2 START3 starts off with a googly that is left alone END START0 START1 START2 START3 once more , gets into that awkward position and ends up defending END START0 START1 START2 START3 nearly squared him up . Was drifting in and BATTER , realising he had moved too far across , defends END START0 START1 START2 START3 that struck him in front , and might even have got an inside edge , so they appeal excitedly . Umpire does n't think so , and FIELDER opts against reviewing . Height might have been an issue END START0 START1 START2 START3 gets a leading edge , but drops harmlessly on the offside END START0 START1 START2 START3 steps back but can only defend to mid-on END START0 START1 START2 START3 another little dab to the onside . BOWLER rushes through his overs so quickly END START0 START1 START2 START3 well flighted , pushes him back . A bit of bounce and turn END START0 START1 START2 START3 crisp drive to mid-off , no run END START0 START1 START2 START3 clever slower ball , BATTER can only nudge it to short extra END START0 START1 START2 START3 wicket-to-wicket line from close to the crease , targeting off stump . No nonsense , basic bowling that 's squeezing the runs END START0 START1 START2 START3 Spun back in and struck him on the pad . Eight off that over END START0 START1 START2 START3 maiden over . He thought about a quick single , but the fielders swirled and he decided otherwise END START0 START1 START2 START3 driven firmly to the offside . Stellar start , this , from END START0 START1 START2 START3 took the pace off , clipped to short midwicket on the bounce END START0 START1 START2 START3 defended to the offside END START0 START1 START2 START3 length ball , poked away to backward point END START0 START1 START2 START3 keeps low and hits the bottom of the bat END START0 START1 START2 START3 whizzes this through wide outside off , BATTER watches it go END START0 START1 START2 START3 nudged into the offside END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length , and BATTER defends this one . Another costly over for England , in more ways than one END START0 START1 START2 START3 nasty bouncer from around the wicket . BATTER did n't know much about that , and it hit the handle of the bat END START0 START1 START2 START3 pace off and that kept low . Went underneath the bat and nearly took off stump with it END START0 START1 START2 START3 darted though and defended END START0 START1 START2 START3 brings it back into the right hander dangerously again , defended to the onside END START0 START1 START2 START3 gets very sharp turn once more . BATTER completely lost his shape on that one as it threatened to squeeze past his bat END START0 START1 START2 START3 short of a length , defended . 9 off that over thanks to BATTER 's pugnacity END START0 START1 START2 START3 comes back with a well-directed bouncer . BATTER does well to get his nostrils out of the way END START0 START1 START2 START3 slower ball to start off , just 75 mph . When I bowl 75 , though , my shoulder 's sore for days END START0 START1 START2 START3 sliced to backward point END START0 START1 START2 START3 good pace and bounce . Defended back to the bowler END START0 START1 START2 START3 targeting the stumps . Driven down to long-on END START0 START1 START2 START3 Gets an inside edge and it bounces up into the air . He ensures it does n't drop onto the stumps by deflecting it away with the bat . I wish that was n't allowed , personally . One of my pet peeves END START0 START1 START2 START3 fizzed through on a tight line outside off END START0 START1 START2 START3 nurdled to the leg side END START0 START1 START2 START3 full length , and pushed down the ground to mid-on . Excellent from BOWLER , rising to the opportunity to crank up the heat , and Australia are going nowhere fast END START0 START1 START2 START3 round the wicket , attacking the left-hander 's stumps on the angle , and flinched from deep in the crease to mid-on END START0 START1 START2 START3 BOWLER bends his back , and sizzles a skiddy bouncer through at 95mph . BATTER limboes , as well he might ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 leaning onto the front foot , and driven back down the pitch END START0 START1 START2 START3 crashes into the pad on the full , but outside leg stump END START0 START1 START2 START3 outside off , pinged through at 92mph , back of a length , poked out to point END START0 START1 START2 START3 fired in flat from round the wicket , and slids on towards a very deep-set back pad . Just about digs it out ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 looped onto a good length , pressed back to the bowler END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length , rising into a compact hopping block . Wheels END START0 START1 START2 START3 huge appeal , sliding into the right-hander , but perhaps doing too much . That was up to 93mph , as BOWLER 's handbrake starts to slip ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 right up to the blockhole , solid connection on the drive , but no timing as mid-on swoops round . I think he 's broken the toe of his bat with that one ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 blocked on the back foot , rising into the splice . Good wheels from BOWLER , who has licence to cut loose now as Australia concentrate on regrouping END START0 START1 START2 START3 trapped on the crease with a full length , leaping into the thigh pad , good shape into the right-hander END START0 START1 START2 START3 leaning onto the front foot to block back to the bowler END START0 START1 START2 START3 round the wicket , a fraction short , BATTER clambers into a pull , almost kneeling at the point of impact END START0 START1 START2 START3 great follow-up ! Beaten all ends up outside off , zipping through to the keeper . Pace is pace innit ... ( as they say in Hackney ) END START0 START1 START2 START3 attempted leave outside off , thumps the under-side of the bat , and down into the crease END START0 START1 START2 START3 length delivery , shaping into the legs , and nurdled square END START0 START1 START2 START3 firm in defence , as BOWLER rolls the fingers on the cutter , perfect probing full length END START0 START1 START2 START3 dead-batted block , soft hands as he waits for the length ball to come onto the bat END START0 START1 START2 START3 through to the keeper , skidding through very low , left alone END START0 START1 START2 START3 lifting on an off-stump line , played very late with soft hands , steered out to the gully as he probes the angles behind square END START0 START1 START2 START3 drawn forward on the front foot END START0 START1 START2 START3 head right over the ball , and pressed into the off side END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length , tucked off the hip as BOWLER hits the deck hard on a middle-and-leg line END START0 START1 START2 START3 length ball outside off , he leaves it alone END START0 START1 START2 START3 on a length on middle and off , he works towards cover END START0 START1 START2 START3  END START0 START1 START2 START3  END START0 START1 START2 START3  END START0 START1 START2 START3  END START0 START1 START2 START3  END START0 START1 START2 START3  END START0 START1 START2 START3  END START0 START1 START2 START3  END START0 START1 START2 START3 blocked on the back foot END START0 START1 START2 START3  END START0 START1 START2 START3 hitting the pitch hard outside off , and blocked to the off side END START0 START1 START2 START3 outside off , left alone END START0 START1 START2 START3 very full length , hint of shape away from the bat . Blocked to the off side END START0 START1 START2 START3 BOWLER drags his length back , and BATTER is in all sorts of bother on the not-quite-cut . That was 92mph , and he struggled to get over the stroke END START0 START1 START2 START3 sharper areas from BOWLER to his bunny BATTER . Hitting the pitch hard outside off , `` Wait on , no ! '' is the cry as he stabs to cover END START0 START1 START2 START3 plopped onto a perfect full length , attacking the top of off , and blocked with a full face END START0 START1 START2 START3 half an appeal as BOWLER thumps the pad , but that 's sliding down END START0 START1 START2 START3 beauty ! Excellent length , hint of nip off the seam , BATTER is trapped flat-footed on the crease as the ball rears past his splice END START0 START1 START2 START3 very full , outside off , drilled back to the bowler , who stops well in his followthrough and sends BATTER sprawling for his crease with a feigned shy END START0 START1 START2 START3 rolls the fingers on the slower ball , and finds a good channel outside off END START0 START1 START2 START3 long-hop outside off , 90mph , but flogged a touch floppily into the covers where FIELDER fields well . He got away with that one END START0 START1 START2 START3 blocked on off stump as BOWLER finds a better length END START0 START1 START2 START3 nip from just back of a length , into the thigh pad as BATTER is tucked up . Good adjustment from BOWLER to close out that over END START0 START1 START2 START3 fuller length this time , BATTER drills a drive from under the eyeline but straight to cover END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length again , BOWLER already veering towards hitting the pitch rather than attacking the edge . Blocked in a rush END START0 START1 START2 START3 probing from BOWLER , blocked on the line of off stump as he pushes the ball across the left-hander END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length , BOWLER just adjusting his line a fraction to avoid those hips , tapped to mid-on END START0 START1 START2 START3 charged down the track but the change of pace bests him END START0 START1 START2 START3 moved across and BOWLER responds with a bouncer . BATTER tried to smear it anyway , but he 's beaten . Eventful over , that END START0 START1 START2 START3 this one only just misses the leg stump as BATTER steps away and tries to smear it through the onside END START0 START1 START2 START3 that is an unplayable yorker , and too good for BATTER . Shame it just missed off stump , because there was little he could have done about it END START0 START1 START2 START3 wide yorker and a dot ball to end END START0 START1 START2 START3 low full toss , and BATTER smiles wryly at missing another one of those . That was one he really should have capitalised on END START0 START1 START2 START3 drops this one shorter . BATTER tried to smear that down to midwicket , but beaten by the ( lack of ) bounce END START0 START1 START2 START3 slower ball and BATTER looked very hesitant dealing with it . Ended up trying to guide it to third man and got beaten END START0 START1 START2 START3 pushes him back with a quick ball that BATTER just about fends off away from his body END START0 START1 START2 START3 squared him up almost . Hits the pads END START0 START1 START2 START3 defended to long-on . That 's BOWLER and FIELDER both done ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 off stump line , good length . No timing on it from BATTER . BOWLER looking to finish strongly END START0 START1 START2 START3 dot ball to finish a really solid spell . Nine wickets and 51 runs , often coming on when the batters were attacking END START0 START1 START2 START3 blocked . We may be looking at a wicket maiden 41st over END START0 START1 START2 START3 rolls his fingers over it once more . The last three overs , Australia have really pulled England back END START0 START1 START2 START3 another slower ball . BATTER looked like he was set up for it , though . Nudged into the offside END START0 START1 START2 START3 BATTER blocks it back . It hits the non-striker 's stumps again , but this time BATTER is well in END START0 START1 START2 START3 driven back and it smacks the stumps at the other end . BATTER was stranded out of his crease , but BOWLER did n't get a hand on it . Lucky break for the England allrounder END START0 START1 START2 START3 good bowling . Good length , a bit of air and some turn . Cut away to the backward point fielder END START0 START1 START2 START3 gets on the front foot and punches it through the offside . Just one off it END START0 START1 START2 START3 another one finding that fielder . Are we really on track for a maiden ? END START0 START1 START2 START3 driven crisply to extra cover , well fielder and he keeps him on strike . Nice over from BOWLER so far END START0 START1 START2 START3 another one that had the pace taken off , BATTER finds the same fielder END START0 START1 START2 START3 slower ball , BATTER gets low and pokes it to backward point END START0 START1 START2 START3 nice shape on that , got a bit of turn and BATTER opted to shoulder arms END START0 START1 START2 START3 that was a bit too close to cut , as BATTER nearly found out to his cost when he nearly chopped it on to his stumps END START0 START1 START2 START3 driven to the offside END START0 START1 START2 START3 hops down the crease once more , only to be forced to poke it to the offside END START0 START1 START2 START3 low full toss , driven down to mid-off END START0 START1 START2 START3 yorker length and he just about digs it out . FIELDER has a shy at the stumps and whacks BOWLER in the leg instead END START0 START1 START2 START3 slight change of action from BOWLER and its jabbed into the onside , only to find the fielder END START0 START1 START2 START3 driven back to the bowler , which sends the non-striker scrambling to get back into his crease END START0 START1 START2 START3 went slightly shorter this time , angled to short midwicket END START0 START1 START2 START3 pulled at a short ball , and the keeper went up as if he 'd got a tickle on it . No reaction from BOWLER , though END START0 START1 START2 START3 well , he connected nicely with that one , and nearly paid for it with his wicket . Straight back at him , but those need to stick . In this case , it popped out of that left hand END START0 START1 START2 START3 driven crisply down to mid-on . BATTER looks good when he middles it even when it does n't fetch any END START0 START1 START2 START3 slower bouncer , and this one 's well targeted . BATTER lets it go END START0 START1 START2 START3 poked into the onside END START0 START1 START2 START3 runs down the track and has an almighty thwack at it . Does n't hit the ball , but fresh air gets a wallop END START0 START1 START2 START3 worked away to midwicket END START0 START1 START2 START3 good finish to the over , cutting back into the pads , and cramped outside off stump END START0 START1 START2 START3 firmly pressed into the off side , tight and probing mid-innings bowling here END START0 START1 START2 START3 fired into the pads , BATTER almost sells himself a dummy while backing up , but scurries back well END START0 START1 START2 START3 fully forward , and pressed back to the bowler END START0 START1 START2 START3 stretching onto the front foot and pushed to cover END START0 START1 START2 START3 blocked on the back foot . No damage done by the extra ball END START0 START1 START2 START3 looks for the big wind-up , but settles for the front-footed block into the covers END START0 START1 START2 START3 whittled off the toes , out to midwicket . BOWLER keeping it admirably tight so far END START0 START1 START2 START3 drawn onto the front foot , solid push back down the wicket END START0 START1 START2 START3 a whistling air-shot , as BATTER lines up something expansive over midwicket , and nearly loses his off stump in the process END START0 START1 START2 START3 an eager cut , climbing into some rare width but ca n't pierce the field END START0 START1 START2 START3 careful now ! Signs of reverse as BATTER makes room for the late cut and so nearly drags on in his haste to readjust END START0 START1 START2 START3 a bit of turn and bounce again as BATTER wears this on the thigh pad . England just beginning to up the ante against his all-sorts ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 tossed up on leg stump , as per ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 short-arm pull , not quite short enough for the stroke as BATTER under-edges to the leg side . That 's a good comeback over END START0 START1 START2 START3 full and straight , very solid block back to the bowler END START0 START1 START2 START3 blotted off the front foot , into the covers , a loud shout of `` no ! '' END START0 START1 START2 START3 another big appeal ! More going for this shout as BOWLER finds late movement into the pads on a full length , but doing too much . And an inside-edge too END START0 START1 START2 START3 tucked off the pads , ca n't find the gap END START0 START1 START2 START3 cutter , tight line , nibbling back into the right-hander , who works with the angle to defend off the legs END START0 START1 START2 START3 much fuller length , wide line outside off , a big swing and a miss END START0 START1 START2 START3 full length , attacking line , blocked firmly to backward point END START0 START1 START2 START3 back and across , England content to milk BOWLER 's tidy offerings END START0 START1 START2 START3 fenced behind square , no width on offer with this angle , bowling to his vast leg-side field END START0 START1 START2 START3 flicked to the leg side END START0 START1 START2 START3 drops the hands and sways inside the line as BOWLER bends his back on off stump END START0 START1 START2 START3 bashed with intent into the covers as BATTER rises into a drive , but ca n't pierce the field END START0 START1 START2 START3 no liberties to be taken on that line and length , tight to off stump , curling towards middle . Blocked END START0 START1 START2 START3 rising on the back foot to defend to the leg side . Tidy over END START0 START1 START2 START3 tossed up , outside leg this time , tapped with the angle back to the bowler END START0 START1 START2 START3 lots of air , BATTER advances but yorks himself in the process . Tapped to mid-on END START0 START1 START2 START3 round the wicket now , curling on a full length , back into the right-hander , firm in defence END START0 START1 START2 START3 jaffer ! That 's a lovely piece of bowling , late jagging outswing , curling past the edge on a perfect length . You do well to nick those ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 outswinger on a full length , BATTER watches it onto a forward defensive END START0 START1 START2 START3 skidding on faster and flatter , and BOWLER is very excited ! It seemed as though BATTER got bat on that , but he was beaten by the change-up , did it flick pad first ? If so , it 's tight . Australia review . Nope , lots of bat . On we go END START0 START1 START2 START3 whipped from outside off stump , and gathered at midwicket END START0 START1 START2 START3 head right over the ball , blocking for all he 's worth END START0 START1 START2 START3 tossed up first ball , and stoutly blocked END START0 START1 START2 START3 banged in short , BATTER ducks as the ball zips over his shoulder END START0 START1 START2 START3 nurdled to the on-side , ca n't create the angle as BOWLER finds a touch of outswing from a full length END START0 START1 START2 START3 pops a touch from back of a length , short midwicket is in business for a split second .. END START0 START1 START2 START3 rising from a full length , tight line on middle and leg . Blocked with hard hands END START0 START1 START2 START3 ripped through at a fair lick , dipping on off stump and clipped to midwicket END START0 START1 START2 START3 clipped off the front foot to short midwicket . England are finding the fielders a little more frequently now END START0 START1 START2 START3 targeting the stumps . Defended back to BOWLER . BATTER has n't really got going just yet END START0 START1 START2 START3 length delivery gunning for the top of middle , worked down to mid-on END START0 START1 START2 START3 nudged into the onside END START0 START1 START2 START3 low full toss , that was the opportunity for a put-away . He timed it well , but straight to the one man stationed in the inner circle END START0 START1 START2 START3 gets a big stride out but can only defend it to the offside END START0 START1 START2 START3 banged in short and BATTER gets under it . Perhaps a tad fortunate not to be called wide given it was tailing down slightly END START0 START1 START2 START3 defended to mid-on END START0 START1 START2 START3 pushes him back with one slightly short of a length , defended END START0 START1 START2 START3 defended . Another excellent over for Australia , just the one of END START0 START1 START2 START3 was there an edge ? Perhaps not . BATTER lunged at that with a bit of belligerence but was beaten completely END START0 START1 START2 START3 carbon copy . Decent little period , this , for Australia END START0 START1 START2 START3 plants the front foot early to block . Looks like he 'll treat BOWLER with respect for now END START0 START1 START2 START3 leg stump line , BATTER blocks END START0 START1 START2 START3 defended . Just three runs off the two post-Powerplay overs END START0 START1 START2 START3 short ball that BATTER gets out of the way of END START0 START1 START2 START3 driven through the cover region END START0 START1 START2 START3 kept a shade low . Bottom edge through to the keeper on the bounce END START0 START1 START2 START3 suddenly , BOWLER looks more dangerous . Cross seamed ball that moves ever so slightly away and nearly nabs the edge END START0 START1 START2 START3 drives nicely but straight to extra cover END START0 START1 START2 START3 nicely flighted and BATTER was a little careful in how he approached it . Might not have been that wary had he still got BATTER at the other end END START0 START1 START2 START3 starts with a flighted one outside off , driven back END START0 START1 START2 START3 banged it in short and he gets out of the way END START0 START1 START2 START3 an attempt at a swivel-pull , but when you do n't make contact , it looks like an ungainly pirouette END START0 START1 START2 START3 excellent end to it . Poked away to the onside . Just 5 off it END START0 START1 START2 START3 been a pretty good comeback this over . Cramps BATTER up once more END START0 START1 START2 START3 again , gives him no room while ensuring he does n't stray down leg side . It 's a very delicate balancing act , but BOWLER needs to nail it constantly END START0 START1 START2 START3 similar line , and BATTER gets a thick inside edge . Better last couple of deliveries END START0 START1 START2 START3 angling away . BATTER opened himself up but realised it was too close to cut through the offside END START0 START1 START2 START3 a leave ! Seems like it 's been awhile since we had one of those END START0 START1 START2 START3 prodded into the onside END START0 START1 START2 START3 a bit of a slog sweep that he lost control of . Got a faint inside edge but it bounced before reaching FIELDER , who was sharp enough to ensure it did n't trickle away for any END START0 START1 START2 START3 defended back to the bowler . Decent comeback END START0 START1 START2 START3 struck on the pads , but too high for the fielders to be legitimately excited END START0 START1 START2 START3 defended to short cover . This , by the way , is England 's highest Powerplay total already this series END START0 START1 START2 START3 there was a hint of inswing , and he was right to be wary as he blocks that into the onside END START0 START1 START2 START3 pitched outside leg stump and hits the pads . They ponder a run that 's never really on END START0 START1 START2 START3 driven back to BOWLER . Decent over , that , for England , 12 off it END START0 START1 START2 START3 full toss at 89mph . Baitstow might have been disappointed not to put that away . At that pace and with the angle , though , even the full tosses look like they could be tricky END START0 START1 START2 START3 pitched on a length and his drive is n't quite middled END START0 START1 START2 START3 prodded into the offside to end the over END START0 START1 START2 START3 banged in short and BATTER ducks under . Does n't seem chuffed by the umpire deciding that 's not a wide , which BATTER wanted on height , apparently END START0 START1 START2 START3 pushes him back with one that 's slightly short of a length . Poked into the offside END START0 START1 START2 START3 gets a genuine outside edge on that , but it bounces well in front of the slip cordon END START0 START1 START2 START3 a straighter line aiming for top of off .
