Moeen defends watchfully END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angled into the pads from a fullish length, and Moeen is hit on the pad.

Steered to point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angled across the left-hander, who steers out to backward point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 width outside off, cut away to backward point where Asalanka fields brilliantly END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pressed out to point in defence END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 googly, BATTER is deep in the crease and jams the bat down to defend END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in, Moeen drops the hands and lets it go through to the keeper END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 punched out towards cover point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 googly, which beats Moeen as he shapes to work through wide mid-on END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 legbreak, defended back to the bowler off the back foot END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full and straight, nudged to short midwicket END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 clipped straight to short midwicket on the bounce END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 defended into the covers with soft hands END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 hung outside off, left alone END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 cut away, into the ground, and fielded at backward point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angled across BATTER, who offers no shot from a length END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 on a length outside off, left alone END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full legbreak, which BATTER drops deep in the crease to. Steers out to backward point with an open face END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full, driven back to BOWLER, who half-stops as he gets down in his follow-through END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 no turn, BATTER comes forward to defend END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pinned on the front pad, loud appeal... Robinson says no! Sri Lanka review without much hesitation. Touch and go on two fronts: did it pitch outside leg stump, and was it too high? Clearly beat him on the inside edge, nipping back in towards the pads. Ball-tracking says... bit of a hold up... here we go: pitched outside leg. Review lost END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angled across him again, left alone END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angled across him, cut away to backward point on the bounce END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angled across him, back of a length.

Straight into the fielder's hands again END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 on top of the bounce once more, point gathers.

Oh my word, Captain Fantastic blinks at the key moment! In the channel on off stump, a regulation nick, low to the keeper's left, but he sticks out a single mitt, and down it goes! Huge moment! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 attempted pull, can't time it as the ball is onto him quickly END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 well bowled, fast and tight to off stump, drawing a sturdy block to the back-of-a-length delivery END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 firmly into line to defend, another tidy over ticked off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pushed off the front foot into the off side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 very full length, and blocked back down the pitch END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 left alone outside off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 a gallop and thwack from BATTER Misses everything, but he fancied a piece of that, back of a length outside off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 curling past the outside edge, pushed across the stumps END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 whipped off the pads to the on-side, can't beat the field END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 driven off the front foot to mid-off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 up on the toes, and punched to cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 high-elbowed push back through the line END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 fuller length this time, BATTER unleashes the drive, but mid-off pounces END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 shape back into the left-hander, a bit of nip from back of a length. This has been a good follow-up to the wickets. Asking the right questions and demanding respect END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 a shimmy out of the crease, but another good-length delivery, dabbed to cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 guided out to point, just back of a length, angled into the off stump END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pops off the splice, bending the back on a tight line to the left-hander END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 over the wicket, blocked on the back foot into the off side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full length, outside off, left well alone END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 squared up on an off-stump line, patted back down the pitch END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 leg-stump line, poked to the on-side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 very full, and pressed with a kneeling stance to cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 well bowled, right up to the blockhole from over the wicket, and solidly dabbed to point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 outside off, no stroke offered END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 better line and length, and blocked respectfully END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 better line, just back of a length, squeezed back down the pitch in defence END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 genuine edge, but falls short of the solitary slip. Up on the toes to block the tight line END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tighter line, bit of lift from back of a length, fenced with a hop into the off side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 panned hard off the full length, up off the deck and straight back at BOWLER's outstretched hand END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 nibble back into the pads, too high for the lbw but that's a taxing line, straightening off the pitch on a good length END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 good length from over the wicket, drawing a high-elbowed stride to the pitch of the ball END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 advancing to the pitch, can't get it away as square leg gathers. A decent recovery in that over END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 in between length, just back of a length with a hint of seam movement. Defended END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, inside-edged defence into the pads END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball on the hip, worked down to long leg but they turn down the single END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 attempts the dipping slower-ball, but it comes out as a knee-high full toss.

END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full, dug out into the off side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pressed to point with an open face END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 fullish on the pads, half-hearted appeal from bowler and keeper, but pitched outside leg stump. Or did it? Morgan reviews. Don't think there was any bat on it, and it hit him on the knee roll so height shouldn't be an issue. Ooh, hold on, there's a little tickle on the inside edge! BATTER survives. END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 defended to short cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 inside-edged into the pad, Bairstow appeals but BOWLER doesn't bother. Looked a touch high, too END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, 89mph/144kph, and Chameera draws the hands inside the line END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in short, and BATTER fends it away towards square leg, taking his bottom hand off the glove, suggesting it might have been hit END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 ...and slip puts down the catch! Root is the man there, diving to his right. Loose waft from BATTER, no foot movement, playing away from his body. BOWLER locates the outside edge, and Root is diving to his right, but puts it down END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in, back of a length, defended awkwardly via the glove. 87mph/140kph END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 short ball, over the left shoulder as BATTER ducks. Thought that looked like a wide, but Mr Gough thinks otherwise END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 plays inside the line as BOWLER angles one across him from over the wicket END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 bouncer, BATTER ducks underneath it. 79mph/128kph, fairly gentle pace END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angling in from a length, defended to short midwicket via the inside edge END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 fenced from under the eyeline into the off side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 wide on the crease, angle into the thighs, and squeezed off the back foot to midwicket. More clear-cut call of no that time END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 outside off, BOWLER tumbles in his followthrough as this one is left alone END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 wafty outside off, can't connect END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 blocked from under the eyeline into the covers... I swear I heard a "run, big lad, run!" from an England fielder, capitalising on the headless chicken-ness going on out there END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 curl into the legs as BOWLER comes over the wicket with his inswinging line END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 stabbed into the off side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 jammed into the covers, and another chaotic piece of running! No idea of who is calling, when or where. For future reference, Billings prowling at backward point tends to be a "hell no!" END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pop from a good length as BOWLER comes round the wicket, rattled on the splice END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 hustled on a fuller length, pressed to the on-side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 sizzling speed on a good length...

Defended END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pressed into the off side, solid areas END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 battered outside the line, on a full length again END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, outside off, pressed into the covers END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 line and length to the left-hander, as you'd expect END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 solid line and length, no liberties taken there END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 onto the front foot to defend, slip in business for the round-the-wicket line END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 hurried into a defensive block, fuller and faster from Moeen, tight line again END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 drawn onto the front foot, and blocked back down the ground END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 probing the top of off, a fine delivery in any format. Jabbed to the off side with a hurried adjustment END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, very tight line, solid in defence on the back foot END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 clattered into the covers, fine strike but straight at the fielder END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 slower ball, back of a length, pushed across the left-hander. Blocked END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 squeezed off a tight line and good length, down into the crease END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 on the back foot, pressed back down the pitch END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 googly, zips into the pads but turning down as BATTER closes his bat on it in the nick of time END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 chopped off the back foot out to cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pops from a good length once more, Curran's finding awkward lift at times on off stump END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 up on the toes, jabbed down to backward point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 zip and bounce, this one explodes away from the right-hander, sticking to over the wicket to mix up the angles END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tapped to the leg side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3  END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 round the wicket, and poked with a full face into the covers. That's a fine over END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 firmly forward, head over the ball END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 dip and wobble on a beautiful length, BATTER can't lay a bat on it as that squeaks past the top of off! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 zinger! Outside off, holding its line on a perfect length, and taking advantage of some tentative footwork to burst past the edge END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 clobbered on the bicep by Curran! He's not express, but he's getting some very awkward lift from a good length, and that's right on the fleshy part, scrambled seam biting the pitch and launching as BATTER gets in a tangle END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full-length legbreak, zippy pace, chopped to gully END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in short, lifts past the upraised bat as BATTER opts out of an uppercut END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 round the wicket again, nip away from the right-hander, on a full length, poked to point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 nip from a full length, from over the wicket, that tucks BATTER up as he hops back into his crease, wearing that on the fingers, and the physio is out to assess the damage END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tidy finish to the over, another googly, just back of a length, and dabbed with the turn to midwicket END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 googly to the well-set BATTER, nudged into the covers END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 every one a coconut in that over, BATTER can only hop into line on off stump and press a defensive block to cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 this is hustly, bustly pace from BOWLER, back of a length, wide on the crease, angle into the right-hander and sharp lift through to the keeper END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 beaten once more, whistling through to the keeper from a good length END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 sharp pace once again, 90mph as BATTER jabs and misses outside off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 wheels outside off, just back of a length with zippy seam movement. Bursts past the outside edge END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 half-forward on a middle-and-leg line, dabbed to cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 zippier pace, flat line, through to the keeper outside off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 googly, on a good length, forward to block END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 head over the ball for a dab to cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tight line, on the spot straightaway and tucked to the leg side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 fuller length, forced out to mid-off. 90mph/145kph END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 vicious short ball, which KJP nearly ducks into. 90mph/145kph, just about gets out of its way at the last moment END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 wide on the crease, angling a full one in from round the wicket. Defended firmly. 90mph/145kph END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angled across him, punched to point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 loose waft outside off as Curran finds some extra bounce from just short of a length. Can't lay bat on ball END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 beauty! How did that not clip off stump?! BATTER played all round this. Round the wicket, sharp movement off the seam to take it away from the bat as he looks to work to leg, and just misses the top of off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 wide on the crease again, drags his length back. 91mph/146kph, and BATTER sways inside the line END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 wide on the crease, skiddy length, steered to backward point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in halfway down, pressed out to cover on the back foot. 89mph/144kph END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angling in from a length, inside-edged towards mid-on END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, BATTER rides the bounce and defends. Can't get off 0! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball, pressed out to Morgan in the covers. Thinks about the single on the slight misfield, but there scampers back END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 hits the splice from a good length, nudging into the leg side. 90mph/145kph END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball, hint of width, and KJP throws his hands at it, looking to flay BOWLER through mid-off. Loses his shape, and BOWLER fields on the bounce by sticking out a left boot in his follow-through. How's your touch? END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 half-volley on off stump, driven straight to mid-off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, tickled into the leg side. 89mph/143kph END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 defended from a length, and that completes the powerplay END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full on leg stump, flicked to leg END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 ooft, thick inside edge saves him. Banana ball, curving a long way back into the right-hander, and he gets a thick edge into the front pad END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 defended from a length, back to BOWLER in his follow-through END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full on the pads, more confident appeal this time... but they opt against the review. "Sliding" was Bairstow's verdict on the stump mic. And on replay, I reckon that's a good call.

Swinging away from a good length at 83mph/133kph END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, punched to extra cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 beauty, which beats the outside edge.

Hit on the hand, and then the ball spins back past the stumps! Good bumper from Binura, gives BATTER the hurry-up, and nearly gets him playing on, too! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 short ball on the hip, worked to the on side but fielded in the ring END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, tapped down towards point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball, BATTER is across and drives, extra covers misses it... but mid-off comes across as Morgan yells "No!" END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angled across from over the wicket, BATTER has a little dabble at it and misses END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 short and wide and BATTER slams a cut, only for Avishka Fernando to pluck it backward point again END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 slower ball, cutting across him, poked calmly into the covers END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pitched up in the channel, driven smoothly towards mid-off coming forwards END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball on off, dropped towards point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 no width here, BATTER hangs back and tucks to midwicket END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pitched up and driven, picks out mid-off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 fired in full at 84mph/136kph, BATTER digs it out END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 short and wide, BATTER hammers a cut... brilliantly stopped by Avishka at backward point! One-handed going to his right, another good bit of fielding there END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in over leg stump, left alone END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 fourth-stump line, skidding on as BATTER diverts it down, wide of the timbers END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 fullish on middle and leg, slight leading edge as BATTER plays across it and skews to mid-on END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full in the channel, BATTER reaches out and drives up to mid-off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball, BATTER dabs at it, gets a fiddly low edge that bounces in front of Perera! Fairy soft hands from the batter, there END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, jumps across and steers it down square END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 over the wicket, shortish on fourth stump, blocked END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 similar line, BATTER is across on off and taps it down END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, angled across and BATTER fishes for it...
