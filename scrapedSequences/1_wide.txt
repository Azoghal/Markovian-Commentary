He looks like he's in some pain too! They're dropping like flies. He's holding his right shoulder and wincing in pain but will soldier on END START0 START1 START2 banged in short again, and BATTER lets it sail harmlessly through to KJP.

Off-side wide END START0 START1 START2 bouncer outside off at 144ks, sails through to Rahul as BATTER avoids it. Too high, so called a wide END START0 START1 START2 oooh tight call on wide. BATTER moves across, well across and the ball goes past him on the legside. Might have flicked his thigh pad if he had stayed where he was. END START0 START1 START2 moving across to get inside the line of this, but BOWLER has strayed too far down leg and that'll be a wide END START0 START1 START2 banged in way too short and it's gone enough over the batsman that it's a wide END START0 START1 START2 dug in short but line gone awry, down leg, and he'll have to rebowl that.

Umpire gives it a wide. BOWLER unhappy with that, he reckons YJB got a thin glove on it while trying to sweep END START0 START1 START2 too far down legside and that's a wide. Pant does well to dive to his left and take it END START0 START1 START2 strays down legside and Pant does well to tumble to his left and gather. But that'll be a wide. END START0 START1 START2 over-cooks this one, still aiming for that wide yorker END START0 START1 START2 Curran aims for the tramlines as Pandya feints to leg, but he's pushed that too wide. This over is not going well... END START0 START1 START2 wide line, targetting the tram-lines, but the wrong side of them on this occasion END START0 START1 START2 wide of off stump, and Buttler looks rather miffed as the umpire's arms are outstretched, but that was just the wrong side of the tramlines END START0 START1 START2 slow bouncer, outside off, a decent option, but he overcooked that as BATTER climbed into the uppercut and missed END START0 START1 START2 whistles down the leg side, half an appeal as the bat flashes through, but mostly an attempt to distract the umpire from stretching his arms. It doesn't work END START0 START1 START2 a touch too wide, just swinging past the tram-lines on this occasion ENDSTART0 START1 START2 another wide, down the leg side.

Speared down the leg side for another wide END START0 START1 START2 lifter outside off, flies through to Buttler, another wide, this one for height END START0 START1 START2 BATTER jumps across off, Sam Curran spots it and digs it down the leg side. BATTER can't pull it away, and it has been deemed a wide END START0 START1 START2 shaping down the leg side, must have clipped the pads to avoid the wide being given ... ah, it was given. As you were! END START0 START1 START2 bouncer, angling away outside off, too high, so BOWLER will have to re-bowl it END START0 START1 START2 short, wide, finishes so wide that it's past the tramline END START0 START1 START2 bumper aimed at Rohit's head, he ducks out of the way. Wide called for height ENDSTART0 START1 START2 banged in short, down the leg side, BATTER climbs into the pull and Rizwan tosses the crowd catch.

Fakhar sways beneath the ball ENDSTART0 START1 START2 back of a length down the leg side, can't connect with the flick END START0 START1 START2 back of a length down the leg side, BATTER can't connect with the tuck off the hip END START0 START1 START2 whizzing down the leg side, good carry but wrong line END START0 START1 START2 back of a length, down the leg side, too far from Fakhar's reach to connect with the flick END START0 START1 START2 back of a length, angling down leg, too far from Babar's reach to be able to flick it END START0 START1 START2 and BOWLER promptly bowls a short one down the leg side. Left alone END START0 START1 START2 banged in short, too short END START0 START1 START2 outside the tramlines, swinging away. We'll have that again END START0 START1 START2 length ball slanting down leg, too far from the batter to attempt the flick END START0 START1 START2 back of a length, bending through the air and can't connect END START0 START1 START2 speared past the legs, a sighter for the left-hander ENDSTART0 START1 START2 fired past the legs... bonus for England in this situation END START0 START1 START2 drags this down. Good over for England, this. After awhile, it seems END START0 START1 START2 bouncer, too short... still a bit leaky from Pakistan. But it's still an ask for England to keep this up all the way END START0 START1 START2 down the leg side, can't connect END START0 START1 START2 pushed across the left-hander, and that looked harsh to me! Fifth-stump, shaping away, BATTER leaves alone and gets the bonus END START0 START1 START2 better line, but still leg-sided. A leaky start from Pakistan. 18 off 6 so far... END START0 START1 START2 curling past the legs, very wide END START0 START1 START2 big wide, dragged way down leg side END START0 START1 START2 sends this wide on the offside, but it's outside the tramlines this time END START0 START1 START2 drags it down END START0 START1 START2 a tangle of limbs down the leg side, half an appeal to distract from the wide END START0 START1 START2 short and leg-sided. Take two END START0 START1 START2 angling down legside and that's another wide. Feels like there've been more wides than singles END START0 START1 START2 starts this one much too straight, and so it's slightly wide down leg END START0 START1 START2 had a smear at that but it was down legside again END START0 START1 START2 rare drag down, and that's a leg side wide END
