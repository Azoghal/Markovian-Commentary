START0 START1 short ball, his third of the over, and therefore, that's given as a wide END START0 START1 fired past the leg stump END START0 START1 fired past the legs, eludes the thigh pad so another bonus run END START0 START1 wide of off stump, back of a length, left alone END START0 START1 down the leg side, a freebie to the cause END START0 START1 fired down the leg side at 91mph, half an appeal, close to the glove as Robinson eventually signals wide, after trying not to give the game away for a possible review! END START0 START1 shaping past the leg stump END START0 START1 banged in short, ducked, and given as a wide END START0 START1 full on the pads, missed out on the glance, but down the leg side END START0 START1 strays down the leg side END START0 START1 back of a length, down the leg side. Half-hearted appeal, in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid this being given as a wide END START0 START1 starts with a wide, spraying one down the leg side and past the pads ENDSTART0 START1 banged in, but BOWLER's bouncer gets up too high END START0 START1 sprayed down the leg side, and KJP does well to get down to his right to stop it. He looks like he's in some pain too! They're dropping like flies. He's holding his right shoulder and wincing in pain but will soldier on END START0 START1 banged in short again, and BATTER lets it sail harmlessly through to KJP. Belatedly given wide, for too many short balls in an over END START0 START1 82mph/132kph, loses this line down the leg side END START0 START1 down the leg side, past the hip, and given wide ENDSTART0 START1 bending down the leg side, a bit of a nothing ball END START0 START1 pushes this down the leg side END START0 START1 googly from Rash, but this fizzes down the leg side END START0 START1 back of a length, sliding through past leg side as Shanaka moves across and lets it go END START0 START1 82mph/132kph, hung out wide, sprays this one a little too far across the right-hander END START0 START1 short and sharp, a decent bouncer but this time he can't lure the wild hook END START0 START1 more swing past the legs. Another wide. Every little helps for Sri Lanka END START0 START1 curls past the legs, BOWLER's finding his swing, but his line is occasionally off END START0 START1 whizzing down the leg side, lots of swing this time, but on the wrong line END START0 START1 BOWLER's radar is all over the place so far, another one speared past the legs with no swing END START0 START1 a whoosh off the pads, but can't connect as that is speared past the legs END START0 START1 bending down the leg side, a bit of a nothing ball END START0 START1 pushes this down the leg side END START0 START1 googly from Rash, but this fizzes down the leg side END START0 START1 back of a length, sliding through past leg side as Shanaka moves across and lets it go END START0 START1 82mph/132kph, hung out wide, sprays this one a little too far across the right-hander END START0 START1 short and sharp, a decent bouncer but this time he can't lure the wild hook END START0 START1 more swing past the legs.

Off-side wide END START0 START1 bouncer outside off at 144ks, sails through to Rahul as BATTER avoids it. Too high, so called a wide END START0 START1 oooh tight call on wide. BATTER moves across, well across and the ball goes past him on the legside. Might have flicked his thigh pad if he had stayed where he was. END START0 START1 moving across to get inside the line of this, but BOWLER has strayed too far down leg and that'll be a wide END START0 START1 banged in way too short and it's gone enough over the batsman that it's a wide END START0 START1 dug in short but line gone awry, down leg, and he'll have to rebowl that. END START0 START1 and now the googly goes wrong, spins past leg stump for back to back wides END START0 START1 line goes awry after that last ball six, and he fires this down legside for a wide END START0 START1 spotted him coming down the track and banged it in short. Too short it turns out and that's a wide for height. Went well over BATTER's head. ENDSTART0 START1 bouncer, going across him, ends up too short and bouncing too high. Wide. END START0 START1 so wide that barely hits the cut strip... eesh END START0 START1 far too wide this time, we'll have that again END START0 START1 tossed up but down leg, he's looking to sweep but misses. Umpire gives it a wide. BOWLER unhappy with that, he reckons YJB got a thin glove on it while trying to sweep END START0 START1 too far down legside and that's a wide. Pant does well to dive to his left and take it END START0 START1 strays down legside and Pant does well to tumble to his left and gather. But that'll be a wide. END START0 START1 over-cooks this one, still aiming for that wide yorker END START0 START1 Curran aims for the tramlines as Pandya feints to leg, but he's pushed that too wide. This over is not going well... END START0 START1 wide line, targetting the tram-lines, but the wrong side of them on this occasion END START0 START1 wide of off stump, and Buttler looks rather miffed as the umpire's arms are outstretched, but that was just the wrong side of the tramlines END START0 START1 slow bouncer, outside off, a decent option, but he overcooked that as BATTER climbed into the uppercut and missed END START0 START1 whistles down the leg side, half an appeal as the bat flashes through, but mostly an attempt to distract the umpire from stretching his arms. It doesn't work END START0 START1 a touch too wide, just swinging past the tram-lines on this occasion ENDSTART0 START1 another wide, down the leg side. Pant does brilliantly to limit the damage with a dive to his right END START0 START1 outside off, swinging away, BATTER shapes to cut, leaves alone... and gets the wide END START0 START1 full and down the leg side for another wide END START0 START1 banged down the leg side for another wide END START0 START1 on a length, spinning and bouncing down leg for a wide END START0 START1 BOWLER appeals for caught behind but this is a leg-side wide. Back of a length and flung down leg END START0 START1 another leg-side wide, there's movement on offer, but it's shaping down the wrong side of the bat END START0 START1 whistling past the legs, good shape on the ball, but swinging too much END START0 START1 fired past the leg stump END START0 START1 fired down the leg side END START0 START1 overcooks that inswinger, way down the leg side END START0 START1 fired down the leg-side, Pant fumbles on the dive, but they don't risk the byes as short fine leg tidies up END START0 START1 Pandya shuffles across off once again, throws Curran off his line. Speared down the leg side for another wide END START0 START1 lifter outside off, flies through to Buttler, another wide, this one for height END START0 START1 BATTER jumps across off, Sam Curran spots it and digs it down the leg side. BATTER can't pull it away, and it has been deemed a wide END START0 START1 shaping down the leg side, must have clipped the pads to avoid the wide being given ... ah, it was given. As you were! END START0 START1 bouncer, angling away outside off, too high, so BOWLER will have to re-bowl it END START0 START1 short, wide, finishes so wide that it's past the tramline END START0 START1 bumper aimed at Rohit's head, he ducks out of the way. Wide called for height ENDSTART0 START1 banged in short, down the leg side, BATTER climbs into the pull and Rizwan tosses the crowd catch. He's playing up to his earlier aberration now END START0 START1 sharp bouncer, BATTER sways inside the line END START0 START1 fired past the leg stump, one notched off the target END START0 START1 fired past the legs this time, decent wheels from BOWLER, who does seem quicker than I remember him in the 2019 Ashes END START0 START1 attempted sweep, misses out, but they get the extra anyway as the ball slides past leg END START0 START1 sharp bouncer, but too high for the umpire's liking. Fakhar sways beneath the ball ENDSTART0 START1 back of a length down the leg side, can't connect with the flick END START0 START1 back of a length down the leg side, BATTER can't connect with the tuck off the hip END START0 START1 whizzing down the leg side, good carry but wrong line END START0 START1 back of a length, down the leg side, too far from Fakhar's reach to connect with the flick END START0 START1 back of a length, angling down leg, too far from Babar's reach to be able to flick it END START0 START1 and BOWLER promptly bowls a short one down the leg side. Left alone END START0 START1 banged in short, too short END START0 START1 outside the tramlines, swinging away. We'll have that again END START0 START1 length ball slanting down leg, too far from the batter to attempt the flick END START0 START1 back of a length, bending through the air and can't connect END START0 START1 speared past the legs, a sighter for the left-hander ENDSTART0 START1 fired past the legs... bonus for England in this situation END START0 START1 drags this down. Good over for England, this. After awhile, it seems END START0 START1 bouncer, too short... still a bit leaky from Pakistan. But it's still an ask for England to keep this up all the way END START0 START1 down the leg side, can't connect END START0 START1 pushed across the left-hander, and that looked harsh to me! Fifth-stump, shaping away, BATTER leaves alone and gets the bonus END START0 START1 better line, but still leg-sided. A leaky start from Pakistan. 18 off 6 so far... END START0 START1 curling past the legs, very wide END START0 START1 big wide, dragged way down leg side END START0 START1 sends this wide on the offside, but it's outside the tramlines this time END START0 START1 drags it down END START0 START1 a tangle of limbs down the leg side, half an appeal to distract from the wide END START0 START1 short and leg-sided. Take two END START0 START1 angling down legside and that's another wide. Feels like there've been more wides than singles END START0 START1 starts this one much too straight, and so it's slightly wide down leg END START0 START1 had a smear at that but it was down legside again END START0 START1 rare drag down, and that's a leg side wide END
