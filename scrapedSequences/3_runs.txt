START0 START1 punched out to deep point off the back foot. Oh my goodness. Buzzers, and then buzzers again! The sweeper throws it in on the bounce, but it's not gathered as it flies over KJP's head after an unusually springy bounce, and then the man backing up hits the stumps at the bowler's end, meaning the ball deflects away for a third! END START0 START1 gets down to reverse-lap, paddling over the keeper, very fine. The fielder gets back to cut it off, but they'll come back for three. 6,000 ODI runs for BATTER END START0 START1 full on leg stump, swept away past short fine leg on the 45.

More intent-laden boshing from Sri Lanka who have come out with a plan this morning END START0 START1 bit of nip off the seam, out to backward square ENDSTART0 START1 stabbed firmly out through the covers, fractionally too full on this occasion, and well clawed in on the edge of the rope with a slide from Malan ENDSTART0 START1 leading edge squirts up and over the man in tight at cover! Length ball, good bounce and a hint of nibble away off the seam, and BATTER looked to clip off the pads.

Another cutter from BOWLER END START0 START1 googly, wide line, cut with the spin by the left-hander, through backward point to bring up the 100. This is getting promising now for Pakistan END
