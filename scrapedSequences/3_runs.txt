START0 START1 START2 START3 punched out to deep point off the back foot . Oh my goodness . Buzzers , and then buzzers again ! The sweeper throws it in on the bounce , but it 's not gathered as it flies over KJP 's head after an unusually springy bounce , and then the man backing up hits the stumps at the bowler 's end , meaning the ball deflects away for a third !

A long chase to the edge of the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 full , straight and swinging , and BATTER flicks nonchalantly away through straight midwicket . FIELDER gives chase ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 smoked through the covers this time !

FIELDER gives chase , but they 'll get back for a third END START0 START1 START2 START3 full , swinging back into the pads , and clipped away through midwicket . The outfield here is famously quick with so many practice pitches across the square , but FIELDER does well to scramble after it and claw it back , just inside the rope ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 that 's well played , fractionally too full on the pads and eased into the gap at wide long-on END START0 START1 START2 START3 panned off a good length , out through cow corner .

Length ball , good bounce and a hint of nibble away off the seam , and BATTER looked to clip off the pads .

FIELDER scampers after it , and cuts it off just short of the boundary . Elegant flick from BATTER , who is batting outside of his crease to negate the swing ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 fullish , close to off stump , nice stride forward for the checked drive straight of mid-off END START0 START1 START2 START3 bottom-handed tonk through wide mid-on .

Think that 's even faster than the last game END START0 START1 START2 START3 cracked into the covers , a firm push through the line END START0 START1 START2 START3 clawed into the deep , where FIELDER does well to drag it back at long-on . Another cutter from END START0 START1 START2 START3 googly , wide line , cut with the spin by the left-hander , through backward point to bring up the 100 .

Work for FIELDER to the square-leg boundary , and he manages to save one ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 short and wide outside off , cuts it nicely through backward point . Good effort in the deep by FIELDER Currant to run around and cut off the boundary but the attempted relay through goes awry as he lobs it out of FIELDER 's reach .

Carries over point but not enough legs to go to the boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 full and wide outside off , BATTER gets it away behind square on the off side and FIELDER just about prevents the boundary .

Bat turned in his hand and not timed that at all but it lands safely over extra cover . Not enough legs on it to go to the boundary though END START0 START1 START2 START3 uppish but in the gap through backward point . Full outside off , he opens the face to drive ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 shuffling onto the back foot , fenced firmly through the covers , and that 's an excellent double-stop on the rope , a sprawling dive first-up , then a well-judged pick-up END START0 START1 START2 START3 nails it in front of square leg . Set up for the slog and cleared his front leg to hammer it into the onside END START0 START1 START2 START3 a thick outside edge , they all count , into acres of space at deep point END START0 START1 START2 START3 tucked into the square leg region , and FIELDER looked a little awkward cutting that off . It enabled England to come back for three , but Australia a shade concerned for FIELDER , who 's supposed to send own the next over END START0 START1 START2 START3 jabbed into the onside and they manage to run three on what is a very long boundary . Anotehr expensive over END START0 START1 START2 START3 half-volley and while BATTER did n't quite time this as well as he wanted , it nearly races away to the short boundary .

Well stopped on the edge of the rope , but lots of intent again ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 that 's the BATTER slot , over-pitched and out comes the cover drive , placement over timing on this occasion , and clawed back inches from the rope ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 dug in short and BATTER top-edges into the leg side ... somehow it lands between two men !

END START0 START1 START2 START3 genuine edge ! A flat drive , not quite to the pitch , and FIELDER has no chance to intercept that .

Decent fielding on the third man rope ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 slower ball outside off and BATTER larrups it through backward point , FIELDER gives chase and hauls it in ... though it then squirts past FIELDER coming the other way !

END START0 START1 START2 START3 a confident slap onto the on side , there 's a bit of a muddle FIELDER backs up FIELDER in the out field and they 've scampered through for three ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 strays down the leg side , poor ball to ease the pressure .

FIELDER catches up with it in time to cut it off , but FIELDER 's relay throw is wayward and they get back for a third END
