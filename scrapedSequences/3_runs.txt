START1 START2 START3 punched out to deep point off the back foot. Oh my goodness. Buzzers, and then buzzers again! The sweeper throws it in on the bounce, but it's not gathered as it flies over KJP's head after an unusually springy bounce, and then the man backing up hits the stumps at the bowler's end, meaning the ball deflects away for a third! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 gets down to reverse-lap, paddling over the keeper, very fine. The fielder gets back to cut it off, but they'll come back for three. 6,000 ODI runs for BATTER END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full on leg stump, swept away past short fine leg on the 45.

A long chase to the edge of the rope END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full, straight and swinging, and BATTER flicks nonchalantly away through straight midwicket. Curran gives chase END1 END2 END3START1 START2 START3 smoked through the covers this time! Back-foot punch, looked to be racing away... only for Pathum Nissanka to pull off a brilliant stop on the boundary END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pitched up and driven, not quite timed but he'll pick up three out towards deep extra cover END1 END2 END3START1 START2 START3 that's well played, fractionally too full on the pads and eased into the gap at wide long-on END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 panned off a good length, out through cow corner. More intent-laden boshing from Sri Lanka who have come out with a plan this morning END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 bit of nip off the seam, out to backward square END1 END2 END3
