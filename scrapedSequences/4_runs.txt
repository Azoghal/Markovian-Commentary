START0 START1 START2 START3 Full toss , flogged through mid-on , that 'll do it ! BATTER mops up the resistance to put England 1-0 up . Wonder if anyone 's managed similar in the football yet ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 climbs into the drive , and the intent burgles him a boundary , off a fat edge through the vacant slip . He 'll take that , even if he was aiming about 100 degrees further into the covers END START0 START1 START2 START3 banged in short , and it does n't really get up off the pitch . BATTER swivel-pulls , and FIELDER , running round from deep backward square , tries to palm it to FIELDER , running round from long leg , but makes a hash of it , and deflects it into the rope ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 short ball , and BATTER nails the pull through midwicket ! Sat up nicely off the pitch at fairly gentle pace , and BATTER swung hard through the line with a full flow , pulling hard in front of square END START0 START1 START2 START3 straighter bat this time , and an elegant cover drive ! That 's better from BATTER , this time he can play the angles as he sees fit , head over the ball and weight flowing through it END START0 START1 START2 START3 the clobbering continues ! Killed softly by BATTER , an over-pitch into the toes , and lovely delicate timing through midwicket END START0 START1 START2 START3 BATTER 's had enough of the respect , a gallop to the pitch this time , and a dragged slog through midwicket . Inelegant but effective END START0 START1 START2 START3 too short , too wide , that 's a rank delivery , and it is duly slotted through the covers , a cut at the top of the bounce . Easy pickings END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length , wide line , slammed with disdain through third man ! Attempted cutter , but just comes out as oodles of time for YJB to pick his spot END START0 START1 START2 START3 over-pitched slower ball , and that is manhandled through long-on ! Cripes , BATTER 's in a mood today . He really , really does n't want to miss kick-off END START0 START1 START2 START3 exquisite from BATTER . He 's so effortlessly violent through the covers , the full arc from point to mid-off is his . This time he aims square as BOWLER over-pitches and nails it to the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 stunning from BATTER ! Up on the toes , just back of the length , and drilled at the top of the bounce through wide long-off ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 overpitched on a full length , and BATTER 's open-faced push pings through extra cover ! That 's a promising start for a batter who likes the ball coming onto the bat END START0 START1 START2 START3 length ball on middle stump , whipped wristily through midwicket ! My goodness . What a shot from the No . 11 ! Shades of Pietersen , rolling the wrists nonchalantly and timing the ball into the gap END START0 START1 START2 START3 bosh ! BATTER has had enough of blocking , and decided to bring out the long handle . Floaty length from BOWLER outside off , and he dongs him back over his head for four . END START0 START1 START2 START3 pumped to the ropes once more ! The elevated route over the covers this time , up and under on a good length ... 'That 's close , Dilly ... '' says FIELDER . Close to what , I 'm not sure ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 c-r-u-n-c-h-e-d through the covers ! That 's exceptional hitting , a touch inside-out , seizing on the tossed-up delivery , waiting for it to dip into his arc . Thump END START0 START1 START2 START3 tossed up above the eyeline , and lamped through the line ! Straight as you like , over the bowler 's head and away to the rope . He 's taken full toll of BOWLER today END START0 START1 START2 START3 cracked off the front foot ! That 's a tremendous authoritative strike , a punch off a good length , a hint of width to free the arms , but the bounce is true and so is the shot END START0 START1 START2 START3 down on one knee , slog-swept very firmly out to deep midwicket , where FIELDER slides over the ball ! Travelling quickly , but could have done better END START0 START1 START2 START3 picks the googly well , drops to one knee , and dumps it hard through long-on . Excellent hard hitting END START0 START1 START2 START3 punched away with an open face through point , and FIELDER ca n't cut it off running back . First boundary for the rockstar . No foot movement , but opened the face nicely , finding the gap between point and cover point in the infield END START0 START1 START2 START3 thrashes at BOWLER 's first ball , which comes down at 89mph , and gets a thickish outside edge down to third for four ! Would have gone just over second slip , but there is n't one there . END START0 START1 START2 START3 squeezed away through backward point for four more ! KJP is on one here . Full and swinging away , and this is a touch of class . Opens the face , piercing the gap between backward point and short third END START0 START1 START2 START3 width outside off , and KJP throws his hands at it . Half-stopped at point by FIELDER , diving to his right , but he can only slow it down on its way to the rope , and FIELDER ca n't cut it off END START0 START1 START2 START3 thick inside-edge , past off stump , and past the diving FIELDER on the half-volley ! Living dangerously END START0 START1 START2 START3 shapes away from the left-hander , but a gentle pace and length , and BATTER laces it through cover-point for four more ! Small press forward , and BATTER drills it past short cover END START0 START1 START2 START3 short , wide , cut away for four ! 78mph/126kph freebie , dug into the pitch , and BATTER throws his hands at it , lofting up and over cover point END
