START0 START1 START2 Full toss, flogged through mid-on, that'll do it! BATTER mops up the resistance to put England 1-0 up. Wonder if anyone's managed similar in the football yet... END START0 START1 START2 climbs into the drive, and the intent burgles him a boundary, off a fat edge through the vacant slip. He'll take that, even if he was aiming about 100 degrees further into the covers END START0 START1 START2 banged in short, and it doesn't really get up off the pitch. BATTER swivel-pulls, and Praveen, running round from deep backward square, tries to palm it to Asalanka, running round from long leg, but makes a hash of it, and deflects it into the rope! END START0 START1 START2 short ball, and Moeen nails the pull through midwicket! Sat up nicely off the pitch at fairly gentle pace, and Moeen swung hard through the line with a full flow, pulling hard in front of square END START0 START1 START2 straighter bat this time, and an elegant cover drive! That's better from BATTER, this time he can play the angles as he sees fit, head over the ball and weight flowing through it END START0 START1 START2 the clobbering continues! Killed softly by BATTER, an over-pitch into the toes, and lovely delicate timing through midwicket END START0 START1 START2 BATTER's had enough of the respect, a gallop to the pitch this time, and a dragged slog through midwicket. Inelegant but effective END START0 START1 START2 too short, too wide, that's a rank delivery, and it is duly slotted through the covers, a cut at the top of the bounce. Easy pickings END START0 START1 START2 back of a length, wide line, slammed with disdain through third man! Attempted cutter, but just comes out as oodles of time for YJB to pick his spot END START0 START1 START2 over-pitched slower ball, and that is manhandled through long-on! Cripes, Jonny's in a mood today. He really, really doesn't want to miss kick-off END START0 START1 START2 exquisite from BATTER He's so effortlessly violent through the covers, the full arc from point to mid-off is his. This time he aims square as Binura over-pitches and nails it to the rope END START0 START1 START2 stunning from BATTER Up on the toes, just back of the length, and drilled at the top of the bounce through wide long-off! END START0 START1 START2 overpitched on a full length, and BATTER's open-faced push pings through extra cover! That's a promising start for a batter who likes the ball coming onto the bat END START0 START1 START2 length ball on middle stump, whipped wristily through midwicket! My goodness. What a shot from the No. 11! Shades of Pietersen, rolling the wrists nonchalantly and timing the ball into the gap END START0 START1 START2 bosh! BATTER has had enough of blocking, and decided to bring out the long handle. Floaty length from Curran outside off, and he dongs him back over his head for four. END START0 START1 START2 pumped to the ropes once more! The elevated route over the covers this time, up and under on a good length... 'That's close, Dilly..." says Bairstow. Close to what, I'm not sure... END START0 START1 START2 c-r-u-n-c-h-e-d through the covers! That's exceptional hitting, a touch inside-out, seizing on the tossed-up delivery, waiting for it to dip into his arc. Thump END START0 START1 START2 tossed up above the eyeline, and lamped through the line! Straight as you like, over the bowler's head and away to the rope. He's taken full toll of BOWLER today END START0 START1 START2 cracked off the front foot! That's a tremendous authoritative strike, a punch off a good length, a hint of width to free the arms, but the bounce is true and so is the shot END START0 START1 START2 down on one knee, slog-swept very firmly out to deep midwicket, where Willey slides over the ball! Travelling quickly, but could have done better END START0 START1 START2 picks the googly well, drops to one knee, and dumps it hard through long-on. Excellent hard hitting END START0 START1 START2 punched away with an open face through point, and Billings can't cut it off running back. First boundary for the rockstar. No foot movement, but opened the face nicely, finding the gap between point and cover point in the infield END START0 START1 START2 thrashes at Wood's first ball, which comes down at 89mph, and gets a thickish outside edge down to third for four! Would have gone just over second slip, but there isn't one there. END START0 START1 START2 squeezed away through backward point for four more! KJP is on one here. Full and swinging away, and this is a touch of class. Opens the face, piercing the gap between backward point and short third END START0 START1 START2 width outside off, and KJP throws his hands at it. Half-stopped at point by Livingstone, diving to his right, but he can only slow it down on its way to the rope, and Billings can't cut it off END START0 START1 START2 thick inside-edge, past off stump, and past the diving Bairstow on the half-volley! Living dangerously END START0 START1 START2 shapes away from the left-hander, but a gentle pace and length, and BATTER laces it through cover-point for four more! Small press forward, and Kusal drills it past short cover END START0 START1 START2 short, wide, cut away for four! 78mph/126kph freebie, dug into the pitch, and BATTER throws his hands at it, lofting up and over cover point END
