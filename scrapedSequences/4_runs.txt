He 'll take that , even if he was aiming about 100 degrees further into the covers END START0 START1 START2 START3 banged in short , and it does n't really get up off the pitch . BATTER swivel-pulls , and FIELDER , running round from deep backward square , tries to palm it to FIELDER , running round from long leg , but makes a hash of it , and deflects it into the rope !

Killed softly by BATTER , an over-pitch into the toes , and lovely delicate timing through midwicket END START0 START1 START2 START3 BATTER 's had enough of the respect , a gallop to the pitch this time , and a dragged slog through midwicket .

Attempted cutter , but just comes out as oodles of time for YJB to pick his spot END START0 START1 START2 START3 over-pitched slower ball , and that is manhandled through long-on ! Cripes , BATTER 's in a mood today . He really , really does n't want to miss kick-off END START0 START1 START2 START3 exquisite from BATTER . He 's so effortlessly violent through the covers , the full arc from point to mid-off is his .

Up on the toes , just back of the length , and drilled at the top of the bounce through wide long-off ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 overpitched on a full length , and BATTER 's open-faced push pings through extra cover ! That 's a promising start for a batter who likes the ball coming onto the bat END START0 START1 START2 START3 length ball on middle stump , whipped wristily through midwicket ! My goodness . What a shot from the No . 11 ! Shades of Pietersen , rolling the wrists nonchalantly and timing the ball into the gap END START0 START1 START2 START3 bosh ! BATTER has had enough of blocking , and decided to bring out the long handle . Floaty length from BOWLER outside off , and he dongs him back over his head for four . END START0 START1 START2 START3 pumped to the ropes once more ! The elevated route over the covers this time , up and under on a good length ... 'That 's close , Dilly ... '' says FIELDER . Close to what , I 'm not sure ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 c-r-u-n-c-h-e-d through the covers ! That 's exceptional hitting , a touch inside-out , seizing on the tossed-up delivery , waiting for it to dip into his arc . Thump END START0 START1 START2 START3 tossed up above the eyeline , and lamped through the line ! Straight as you like , over the bowler 's head and away to the rope . He 's taken full toll of BOWLER today END START0 START1 START2 START3 cracked off the front foot ! That 's a tremendous authoritative strike , a punch off a good length , a hint of width to free the arms , but the bounce is true and so is the shot END START0 START1 START2 START3 down on one knee , slog-swept very firmly out to deep midwicket , where FIELDER slides over the ball ! Travelling quickly , but could have done better END START0 START1 START2 START3 picks the googly well , drops to one knee , and dumps it hard through long-on . Excellent hard hitting ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 short ball swung away on the pull , and the misfield at deep backward square ensures this will be the winning hit ! England home by eight wickets , a stroll in Sarf Lahndan wraps up some more WC Super League points END START0 START1 START2 START3 drilled through the covers ! The chase has been pootling towards its conclusion , and that shot sees them almost there END START0 START1 START2 START3 Boshed ! Short ball , but it does n't get up enough to trouble BATTER , who swings it in front of deep square END START0 START1 START2 START3 wide outside off , and BATTER flashes at the slower ball , chipping it just over FIELDER 's head at backward point ! All the luck is falling to FIELDER rather than BOWLER . Top-edged , and FIELDER flung himself back , but could n't get a finger-tip on it ! ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 battered off the front foot , beats FIELDER in the covers for a welcome boundary ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 battered off the front foot , beats BATTER in the covers for a welcome boundary ! END
