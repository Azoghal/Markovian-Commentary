START0 START1 START2 Full toss, flogged through mid-on, that'll do it! BATTER mops up the resistance to put England 1-0 up. Wonder if anyone's managed similar in the football yet... END START0 START1 START2 climbs into the drive, and the intent burgles him a boundary, off a fat edge through the vacant slip. He'll take that, even if he was aiming about 100 degrees further into the covers END START0 START1 START2 banged in short, and it doesn't really get up off the pitch. BATTER swivel-pulls, and Praveen, running round from deep backward square, tries to palm it to Asalanka, running round from long leg, but makes a hash of it, and deflects it into the rope! END START0 START1 START2 short ball, and Moeen nails the pull through midwicket! Sat up nicely off the pitch at fairly gentle pace, and Moeen swung hard through the line with a full flow, pulling hard in front of square END START0 START1 START2 straighter bat this time, and an elegant cover drive! That's better from BATTER, this time he can play the angles as he sees fit, head over the ball and weight flowing through it END START0 START1 START2 the clobbering continues! Killed softly by BATTER, an over-pitch into the toes, and lovely delicate timing through midwicket END START0 START1 START2 BATTER's had enough of the respect, a gallop to the pitch this time, and a dragged slog through midwicket. Inelegant but effective END START0 START1 START2 too short, too wide, that's a rank delivery, and it is duly slotted through the covers, a cut at the top of the bounce. Easy pickings END START0 START1 START2 back of a length, wide line, slammed with disdain through third man! Attempted cutter, but just comes out as oodles of time for YJB to pick his spot END START0 START1 START2 over-pitched slower ball, and that is manhandled through long-on! Cripes, Jonny's in a mood today. He really, really doesn't want to miss kick-off END START0 START1 START2 exquisite from BATTER He's so effortlessly violent through the covers, the full arc from point to mid-off is his. This time he aims square as Binura over-pitches and nails it to the rope END START0 START1 START2 stunning from BATTER Up on the toes, just back of the length, and drilled at the top of the bounce through wide long-off! END START0 START1 START2 overpitched on a full length, and BATTER's open-faced push pings through extra cover! That's a promising start for a batter who likes the ball coming onto the bat END START0 START1 START2 length ball on middle stump, whipped wristily through midwicket! My goodness. What a shot from the No. 11! Shades of Pietersen, rolling the wrists nonchalantly and timing the ball into the gap END START0 START1 START2 bosh! BATTER has had enough of blocking, and decided to bring out the long handle. Floaty length from Curran outside off, and he dongs him back over his head for four. END START0 START1 START2 pumped to the ropes once more! The elevated route over the covers this time, up and under on a good length... 'That's close, Dilly..." says Bairstow. Close to what, I'm not sure... END START0 START1 START2 c-r-u-n-c-h-e-d through the covers! That's exceptional hitting, a touch inside-out, seizing on the tossed-up delivery, waiting for it to dip into his arc. Thump END START0 START1 START2 tossed up above the eyeline, and lamped through the line! Straight as you like, over the bowler's head and away to the rope. He's taken full toll of BOWLER today END START0 START1 START2 cracked off the front foot! That's a tremendous authoritative strike, a punch off a good length, a hint of width to free the arms, but the bounce is true and so is the shot END START0 START1 START2 down on one knee, slog-swept very firmly out to deep midwicket, where Willey slides over the ball! Travelling quickly, but could have done better END START0 START1 START2 picks the googly well, drops to one knee, and dumps it hard through long-on. Excellent hard hitting END START0 START1 START2 punched away with an open face through point, and Billings can't cut it off running back. First boundary for the rockstar. No foot movement, but opened the face nicely, finding the gap between point and cover point in the infield END START0 START1 START2 thrashes at Wood's first ball, which comes down at 89mph, and gets a thickish outside edge down to third for four! Would have gone just over second slip, but there isn't one there. END START0 START1 START2 squeezed away through backward point for four more! KJP is on one here. Full and swinging away, and this is a touch of class. Opens the face, piercing the gap between backward point and short third END START0 START1 START2 width outside off, and KJP throws his hands at it. Half-stopped at point by Livingstone, diving to his right, but he can only slow it down on its way to the rope, and Billings can't cut it off END START0 START1 START2 thick inside-edge, past off stump, and past the diving Bairstow on the half-volley! Living dangerously END START0 START1 START2 shapes away from the left-hander, but a gentle pace and length, and BATTER laces it through cover-point for four more! Small press forward, and Kusal drills it past short cover END START0 START1 START2 short, wide, cut away for four! 78mph/126kph freebie, dug into the pitch, and BATTER throws his hands at it, lofting up and over cover point ENDSTART0 START1 START2 short ball swung away on the pull, and the misfield at deep backward square ensures this will be the winning hit! England home by eight wickets, a stroll in Sarf Lahndan wraps up some more WC Super League points END START0 START1 START2 drilled through the covers! The chase has been pootling towards its conclusion, and that shot sees them almost there END START0 START1 START2 Boshed! Short ball, but it doesn't get up enough to trouble BATTER, who swings it in front of deep square END START0 START1 START2 short ball tucked off the hip, that will trickle away fine! Just a touch and away it scoots to the rope, fielder won't get round END START0 START1 START2 creamed through the covers! Pitched up on the slot and BATTER greases a drive to the rope END START0 START1 START2 brings out the reverse-sweep, nailing it past the man at slip, and beating backward point to his right! Asalanka dived to his right, but it burst through his hands END START0 START1 START2 full, angling in towards off stump, and BATTER effortlessly flicks through midwicket. Played somewhat across the line but expertly picked the gap, rolling the wrists and picking up four more END START0 START1 START2 skips down and gives himself room outside leg stump, flashing at the cut and nailing it up and over point for four! END START0 START1 START2 top-edges the pull... over KJP's head for four! Gets up much more this time, speared in halfway down, and it got big on BATTER He was late on the pull, and it flew up and over the keeper END START0 START1 START2 pulled firmly off the hip, and Asalanka can't get round to his right to cut it off! Banged in short, but doesn't get up much, and BATTER's timing is spot on END START0 START1 START2 speared in full on the pads, and flicked down to long leg. Asitha does brilliantly to dive to his right and save two runs. The TV umpire will check this... and it's four! Asitha was over-zealous in his attempts to pick it up and get the throw in, and was still in contact with the rope at the time END START0 START1 START2 flashes at one wide outside off, and just beats that man catching at gully! Length ball, BATTER gets across to cut, and it flies to the left of the man in tight, DdS END START0 START1 START2 half-volley on off stump, lashed away through extra cover! Angled across him, but plenty of width, and BATTER's fast hands take over on the drive END START0 START1 START2 much cleaner this time! One bounce, lashed over the umpire's head, and over the rope. Full wrong 'un from BOWLER, bit of a half-volley, and BATTER takes a big stride to thump it down the ground END START0 START1 START2 skips down the track to drag BOWLER up and over midwicket. Googly, which BATTER didn't seem to pick, but he met the ball on the half-volley and found the gap in the deep END START0 START1 START2 very full, YJB nearly yorks himself! Makes room and swings hard, gets a thick inside edge low past the keeper for four! END START0 START1 START2 slogged over the leg side, gets a good chunk of Asitha's slower ball. Legcutter, I think. Slapped, regardless END START0 START1 START2 whump, there it is! Slightly overpitched and BATTER is quickly forward to thrash through the line, dispatching the ball with a crack through extra cover. He finally gets one away END START0 START1 START2 crrrrrrrrrrrunched! Checks the hands but still sends it whistling through point, too much width this time and he cashes that cheque END START0 START1 START2 scooped off the pads, Chameera can only tip it for four! Binura has fine leg and deep backward square out, but BATTER got it in between them both END START0 START1 START2 that's how you do it, Jonny, no need to overhit them, BATTER coming forwards and easing a punch through midwicket for four1 END START0 START1 START2 punched back past the bowler, this is going to run fine of mid-off, too... and Chameera's slide then takes him into contact with the rope before he let go of the ball, so it'll be four despite his efforts END START0 START1 START2 whisked off the pads through backward square! Casually flicked to a vacant part of the field, runs away to the shortest boundary END START0 START1 START2 laced through the covers! Floaty full ball on a tempting wide line and BATTER launches into a cover drive. Hold the pose END START0 START1 START2 rammed off the pads in front of square! Poor ball from BOWLER, full and straight at 87mph/140kph and BATTER just whips the hands through END START0 START1 START2 length ball outside off, BATTER jumps out and throws the hands, phat inside edge through midwicket... runs away to the rope! BATTER lost his shape completely there, but still picked up four END START0 START1 START2 wide outside off, and Binura flashes at the slower ball, chipping it just over Roy's head at backward point! All the luck is falling to Sam rather than Tom. Top-edged, and Roy flung himself back, but couldn't get a finger-tip on it! END START0 START1 START2 slower ball from wide on the crease which deceives Binura, but his inside-edge will race away for four! Back-of-the-hander, and Binura had no idea where this was going, but gets a slice of luck and picks up four END START0 START1 START2 wide on the crease, BATTER gets down on one knee to loft Curran up and over extra cover! Some shot, this! He played a nice cameo in the final T20I at the Ageas, and this is a statement of intent END START0 START1 START2 banged in, back of a length, and pulled away off the hip. Races away, and beats Root to his right at deep backward square! Nice roll of the wrists, finding the gap between long leg and square leg END START0 START1 START2 skips down, and bludgeons BOWLER over long-off! Tossed up, shimmied down to the pitch of the ball, and thumped it down the ground for four END START0 START1 START2 low full toss, swept away behind square to pick up a long-awaited boundary END START0 START1 START2 angled across him, and this is a touch of class from DdS as he moves into the 90s. Length ball outside off, holding its line, and with short third inside the ring, DdS opens the face and steers it to his left END START0 START1 START2 clouted up and over mid-off for four! Slower ball again, and DdS sits deep in his crease waiting for it out the back of the hand. Mid-off was up inside the ring, so he just needed enough on it to clear him END START0 START1 START2 uppercut down to third man! Cleverly done by BATTER, realising that the fielder had just come up into the ring, he rocked back and flicked the wrists to send the bouncer flying towards the rope END START0 START1 START2 picks the slower variety and clouts over midwicket! BATTER gets hold of his pull and collects four END START0 START1 START2 full and slightly leg side, BATTER is across, deftly paddles this fine! Beautifully done and it runs away END START0 START1 START2 placed for four wide of third man! Cutter from BOWLER and DdS just waits on it, angles the face, and guides behind square END START0 START1 START2 drilled through the covers! Slower ball from Curran, a cutter wide of off stump, but he's seeing it well and smears four. Doesn't need to move END START0 START1 START2 dug in short, sits up nicely, BATTER whumps it up and over midwicket! Too powder puff from Curran and he's collared on the pull, high and handsome into the outfield END START0 START1 START2 ooft, lovely shot through mid-off again. Lovely timing. Straighter this time, past Wood's left hand as he dived in his follow-through, then past Willey's right at mid-off. Compact shot, economy of movement END START0 START1 START2 punched through wide mid-off for four! 91mph/146kph, but in the slot, and DDS gets forward to present the face, timing it beautifully past the man in the ring END START0 START1 START2 nailed through straight midwicket for four more! DDS is enjoying this pull shot today. Back of a length, enough width to free his arms, and clubbed away into the gap END START0 START1 START2 flashed away through cover point! What a shot this is. Back of a length from BOWLER, and DDS unfurls a back-foot punch, holding the pose as it races past backward point and away to the rope END START0 START1 START2 banged in halfway down, and nails another pull through straight midwicket! Full-blooded shot, rocking onto the back foot, and DDS has had enough of knocking it around, putting a dent in Curran's figures END START0 START1 START2 banged in halfway down, and DDS pulls hard through midwicket for four! 78mph/126kph from Curran, gentle pace, and BATTER latches onto the pull, past the man in tight END START0 START1 START2 full and straight, and DDS tonks BOWLER back over his head! Some attacking intent. Cleanly-struck, straight down the ground with a full-blooded drive. Couple of bounces and over the rope END START0 START1 START2 angling in, but a bit of a half-volley, and BATTER creams it through the covers! Great shot. High front elbow, holds the pose in the follow-through. One for the snappers. Sri Lanka up and running ENDSTART0 START1 START2 battered off the front foot, beats Morgan in the covers for a welcome boundary! END START0 START1 START2 full toss, and blatted through backward point! BOWLER is struggling to grip the ball this time. Loose resumption END START0 START1 START2 tossed up and thumped through the covers. That's a tidy restart END START0 START1 START2 steered through point first ball! Hanging back, playing well away but he gets a good connection. Seems Roy waved it by at backward point, thinking there was a sweeper out there! END START0 START1 START2 scooped high over square leg, gets a good chunk of it and the ball bounces just in front of the rope, skips away for four! END START0 START1 START2 smashed through the leg side! Dug in short by BOWLER and BATTER moves across his stumps, larrups it for four END START0 START1 START2 clubbed off the back foot, that's a firm strike, and excellently timed. Enough width to seize upon, and a despairing slide at wide long-off END START0 START1 START2 eased off the front foot, clean through the covers! Just skids onto the bat, and all it takes is timing and placement. Easy when you know how END START0 START1 START2 up on the toes, and that's elegant!

Enough width to seize upon, and a despairing slide at wide long-off END START0 START1 START2 eased off the front foot, clean through the covers! Just skids onto the bat, and all it takes is timing and placement. Easy when you know how END START0 START1 START2 up on the toes, and that's elegant! Width outside off, rising into the shot with sweet timing, clean through point END START0 START1 START2 tailing into the legs, and helped through fine leg. Slightly misdirected first-up END START0 START1 START2 clattered through the covers, get some of that! Proper intent from the outset, meeting the big outswinger with a full flow of the bat ENDSTART0 START1 START2 tossed up on middle and leg, BATTER muscles it away between deep midwicket and wide long-on for four END START0 START1 START2 much fuller and attacking the stumps, Moeen lays into it, smiting it past the left of the bowler, and right of long-on END START0 START1 START2 hip-high short ball outside off, BOWLER doesn't have the pace to trouble BATTER He climbs into this and nails a pull to the midwicket fence END START0 START1 START2 slog-swept in the air but to the left of deep midwicket. Moeen stretches out, takes it from outside off, and dispatches it away to the leg-side boundary END START0 START1 START2 dragged down on middle, BATTER jumps back in a flash and swats it away to the right of deep midwicket and left of deep square. Nifty footwork from BATTER END START0 START1 START2 pitched up and outside off, BATTER - split webbing and all - leans into it and caresses it through the covers, beating sweeper in the deep END START0 START1 START2 full and spinning down the leg side, helped away to the left of Rahul with a fine sweep END START0 START1 START2 oh that's audacious. back of a length outside off and BATTER rises with the ball, opens the face and plays it uppishly over backward point. END START0 START1 START2 too short again, and he goes low to pull this powerfully to the deep square leg boundary. Raises his fifty in style. He's been unstoppable END START0 START1 START2 crashed through cover. There's a man at deep cover but this was hit so hard that he couldn't get to his right in time. A bit short, he gets a free swing of his arms outside off and thumps it END START0 START1 START2 full swinging into him and BATTER simply shows the full face of the bat to drive it straight back past the bowler. A little too full but when a batsman is hitting these balls so effortlessly, you have to wonder what a bowler can do. END START0 START1 START2 stays still this time and it's fuller on the stumps, so he unfurls the sweep, nails it beautifully and sends it screaming across the turf to the square leg boundary END START0 START1 START2 just clears mid-on. Slightly short and he opens up his stance to pull, gets it on the toe-end but hit hard enough to go over a leaping mid-on fielder. Brushed Bhuvneshwar's fingertips END START0 START1 START2 back of a length outside off and BATTER has done this so skilfully. Stands tall, opens the face and punches superbly to get it past backward point, to his right END START0 START1 START2 no second guesses about that one. Full outside off and he leans into a sparkling square drive END START0 START1 START2 and he goes again Four lofted drives in this over, and it's not yet done. Krunal chases after it at long-on and tries to pull it in, but it's hit the boundary. Fuller again, he goes harder at that, gets it off the inside half of the bat but meaty enough that it flies over mid-off END START0 START1 START2 he's just picking his spots. BOWLER keeps it too full and BATTER comes gleefully on the front foot and drives over cover. END START0 START1 START2 too short, and he's quickly onto it, swivels and pulls to the deep square leg boundary END START0 START1 START2 magnificent. Too full outside off and he comes on the front foot to drive it straight back past the bowler. END START0 START1 START2 he's moved across and ramped it fine. Pre-meditated movement across the stumps, length outside off converts to a ball he can pick up and send past the keeper END START0 START1 START2 too short and going down leg, swivels and pulls to the deep square leg boundary END START0 START1 START2 Dismissive. Full and wide outside off and he throws the kitchen sink at it while flaying it over extra cover. Goes flat and bounces just once before the boundary END START0 START1 START2 sweeps well and finds the deep square leg boundary. Fuller and he got a big stride out while going down on his knee and had to still use his long reach to sweep that over square leg END START0 START1 START2 full outside off and BATTER comes on the front foot to loft his cover drive elegantly, bounces once before going over the rope END START0 START1 START2 stand and deliver. Fuller on the stumps, clears his front leg and pulls out a golf swing through the line, sends it straight over the bowler's head, two bounces and into the boundary END START0 START1 START2 he's find the boundary all over. Too full outside off, and he just seemed to push it gently, but the timing's excellent and he has threaded the gap at cover to find another boundary END START0 START1 START2 too full and that's imperiously flicked off his toes to the backward square leg boundary. Superb batting by BATTER Dealt with the short stuff, then dealt with the full one too END START0 START1 START2 short again, this time he pulls behind square. This one bounced a bit higher, so BATTER swivelled further and smashed it END START0 START1 START2 short and BATTER deals with it fiercely. Sat up for him, he swivels and clubs a pull shot to the deep midwicket boundary END START0 START1 START2 and he follows that slower ball with a sharp bouncer outside off that has BATTER following it with his hands. Outside edge flies off, and Buttler diving to his right can't get to it. END START0 START1 START2 short again, but dealt with superbly by BATTER He's had his problems with the short ball but this is expertly done. Swivelled and pulled powerfully through midwicket END START0 START1 START2 finds the gap at backward point. Short and given room outside off, BATTER stays still and cuts powerfully through backward point END START0 START1 START2 short outside off, and BATTER pulls with authority to deep square leg. The fielder at deep square leg has hurt his shoulder trying to stop that. He clutching his left shoulder, Billings the man there. Unfortunatley for him, his foot was in contact with the boundary when he tried to flick the ball back in so it's a boundary anyway. Was sprinting to his right and went down to pull the ball back in, tumbled and fell, the shoulder bore the brunt of the fall. END START0 START1 START2 marvellously controlled. Banged in short on off, rising to chest high, BATTER transfers weight back and swivels, timing the pull well and controlling it expertly to keep it down and pick the gap at square leg END START0 START1 START2 overpitched and outside off, BATTER leans into it and punchily drives it between extra-cover and mid-off for four. Top shot to bring up a century stand with his captain END START0 START1 START2 drilled away to the left of deep midwicket! Fullish and just a shade outside off, BATTER stretches out and sweeps it flat and hard END START0 START1 START2 darted flat and quick into the pads, duly tickled away fine past the keeper for back-to-back boundaries END START0 START1 START2 pushed through outside off, driven through the line, another mishap in the field, this time Stokes lets the ball burst through his hands at mid-off END START0 START1 START2 dragged down on middle, slider from BOWLER, but it's too short. BATTER jumps back and swats it away to the right of deep midwicket END START0 START1 START2 full and fired wide of off, BATTER plants his front foot, opens the bat-face and deliberately carves it away to the left of sweeper cover for four END START0 START1 START2 pushed through full on off, BATTER stretches out and belts it away straight past BOWLER for four. Big bottom-hand drive from BATTER END START0 START1 START2 shortish and outside off, sits up to be hit. BATTER swivels on the back foot and pulls it smartly through the gap at midwicket END START0 START1 START2 floated too full and outside off, no movement, BATTER leans into it, shows the full face of the bat, drilling it between extra-cover and mid-off for four END START0 START1 START2 floated on the pads, overpitched and picked off between deep square leg and long leg for four END START0 START1 START2 that's a dismissive pull from Rohit. He forays down the track, T Curran drags it shorter and outside off. Down the track and smacked over midwicket with immense authority END START0 START1 START2 short ball down leg, and he swivels to pull this fine from chest height. Gets a bit of a top edge but that won't matter because he's kept this very fine and he'll get the boundary END START0 START1 START2 gorgeous. The last time he got this pristine timing to a straight drive in this over, it went to a fielder. Now it's a bit straighter and no fielder is getting near that. The ball Rolls Royces to the straight boundary END START0 START1 START2 driven on the up, imperiously over cover. On a driveable length and Rohit stands tall, frees his arms and doesn't bother to keep it down because it's in the gap END START0 START1 START2 and now he brings out the drive. BOWLER went fuller outside off, maybe because of the last ball, and BATTER powers a drive through extra cover, with minimal foot movement. END START0 START1 START2 nails the cut this time. Shorter from BOWLER, he still kept it right outside off but BATTER was in perfect control, rising up with the ball and cutting from close to his body, middling it and placing it through cover END START0 START1 START2 paddled fine. They had to break the stranglehold England's bowlers were building and Rohit chose to do it by paddling a full length ball on off over short fine leg END START0 START1 START2 too much room outside off, and it's too short, BATTER rides the bounce and cuts it nicely through square to find the boundary ENDSTART0 START1 START2 flashes at it and gets an outside edge that goes very fine. Boundary to third man. END START0 START1 START2 too short from BOWLER, and BATTER able to go right back and slam a pull shot to the midwicket boundary. Bent the knee nicely while swivelling END START0 START1 START2 down the track and leathers this straight back past the bowler. Rohit Sharma is down at the straight boundary. Looks like a left elbow issue. Doesn't look good. Rohit's flat on the ground. This was fuller and BATTER just sauntered down and slammed it back past the bowler. Rohit at long-on ran to his right and dived, couldn't stop the ball. Okay he's back up and smiling now, so not too much damage. END START0 START1 START2 slower bouncer attempted outside off, sits up for BATTER to unwind and have a mighty whack of a pull at it. Once bounce and into the midwicket boundary END START0 START1 START2 boom he goes straight over the bowler's head. Full toss on off, clears his front leg and slams it straight back. Gets four, which might feel like he's under-achieving. END START0 START1 START2 rifled through wide long-off! Too short, on that wide line, you can't cramp anyone's style there! END START0 START1 START2 flogged so hard through midwicket! Back of a length, BATTER swivels into his pull, and the bottom hand comes off as he does so. But it makes no difference, that has fizzed! END START0 START1 START2 scuffed over the close catcher at midwicket! it's another four, but nearly a misjudgement as BATTER went for the big wind-up, and hit that flatter than intended END START0 START1 START2 oops, that's too short and wide! BATTER can't hit it where he intended, but it doesn't matter. A thick edge through third man to get the over off to a flyer END START0 START1 START2 lamped through the line! That's Bhuve's most hittable ball of the series, in the slot outside off, a free of the arms through long-off END START0 START1 START2 a flat pull through backward square! Too short, hanging on the back foot, waiting for the drag-down and dispatching it! END START0 START1 START2 drilled through long-off! BATTER is a majestic driver in one-day cricket, so good at picking the gaps with power. That was straight, and violent! END START0 START1 START2 swivel-pull, more runs! Too short, into the hips, that whistled through backward square END START0 START1 START2 back of a length outside off, he stands tall and punches off the backfoot. Such superb timing that once it bisected the gap at cover, it was a boundary all the way END START0 START1 START2 too short, and BATTER is not going to hang about on those. Rocks back and pulls it with authority through midwicket END START0 START1 START2 another one that comes into him, but this time he manages to get bat down the right line and glances it fine, beats short fine leg END START0 START1 START2 slashed over cover. Too short and too wide outside off, he threw his bat at it, didn't middle it but there's no fielder back there so it was a very safe shot. The ball just about trickles over the boundary END START0 START1 START2 magnificent. Punched off the back foot while standing in his crease, bullet straight and screams across the grass to the straight boundary. END START0 START1 START2 marvellous. He had bowled a good bouncer last over, tries to do it again. Doesn't get it too wrong, it's sharply rising outside off, but BATTER is perfectly balanced and just upper-cuts it over slip. END START0 START1 START2 overdoes the short ball, this time it's too short and BATTER calmly moves inside the line and helps it to the fine leg boundary. He didn't try to over-hit, just timed and placed it END START0 START1 START2 too short again, he swivels and pulls through square leg this time. The previous ball had more power, this one had more timing END START0 START1 START2 smack. Too short, and sat up, pulls through midwicket on the front foot with power END START0 START1 START2 digs it in short and BATTER is quickly onto that, fetches the pull from outside off, gets on top of the ball, and puts it in the gap through midwicket END START0 START1 START2 lovely shot. Too full on off, he transfers weight forward and on-drives to perfection, holds his shape and the pose as the ball races to the straight boundary END START0 START1 START2 pumped through wide long-off! So close to another good delivery, but BATTER's wristwork is outstanding, nailing it hard past the diving short cover END START0 START1 START2 thrashed through the covers! BATTER's first boundary, as he climbs on top of a wide ball, and slaps hard down on the ball END START0 START1 START2 low full-toss, and Curran nearly loses his knee-caps on a violent flog through the line! Stand your ground man, it's only pain! What would Brian Close say? END START0 START1 START2 close to Rashid at short fine leg, but another four! BATTER rushes to fifty with a violent flick off his legs, trusting his timing to beat the close catcher, and nailing it behind square! END START0 START1 START2 too short from Curran, his variations are meat and drink to India right now, BATTER hops into line, and plinks his pull in front of the sweeper at fine leg END START0 START1 START2 that's a hit-me ball! Short and wide, a variation maybe, but a pie in execution. Larruped through point with a massive wind-up END START0 START1 START2 banged in too short, on the legs, rifled though midwicket! BOWLER has been an intermittent threat but his inexperience has been picked off in between whiles. BATTER is beginning to find his range END START0 START1 START2 round the wicket, banged in too short and BATTER climbs into the pull! That was a meaty connection, like a juicy rib-bone, and it thumps the boundary sponge on the half-volley END START0 START1 START2 given room outside off and he's crashed that hard, Ben Stokes lets it through at cover. second time in two games he's had that happen to him. Too short and he goes back to thrash it hard, Stokes was wrong-footed as he was anticipating the ball coming to his right, had to stop and go left, but couldn't get there. No protection behind him END START0 START1 START2 googly outside off, but he cuts it well, pierces the gap between point and short third man to find the boundary END START0 START1 START2 regal from BATTER Tossed up but too full outside off, he comes on the front foot, and unleashes a flowing cover drive that purrs all the way to the cover boundary END START0 START1 START2 Squeezed through the cordon! Another streaky four for India, they are slim pickings at the moment, an excellent yorker from BOWLER, so nearly wriggling through, but toe-ended out of everyone's reach END START0 START1 START2 inside edge, and that's very streaky! Down the pitch to that one, as telegraphed with his first ball, India just itching to have a go, and Buttler dives to his left but can't intercept a flying deflection END START0 START1 START2 too full to open his account, and BATTER pings his first ball off the pads through midwicket! Pressure already END START0 START1 START2 banged in short and hoisted over midwicket again! BOWLER is rather flailing through this over now, needs to finish well END START0 START1 START2 short and wide, and clattered through point! BOWLER's losing his radar a touch in this over END START0 START1 START2 plinked over deep midwicket! A jiucy leg-stump half-volley to launch his fourth over, and Rohit isn't missing out on those! END START0 START1 START2 too straight from Curran, and that's a freebie! Swinging into the legs, and helped around the corner, clean through fine leg END START0 START1 START2 spoke too soon! A wide half-volley to finish the over, and Rohit gratefully spanks that through the covers. A loose one to end another fine over END START0 START1 START2 high-elbowed punch! Clean down the ground, Rohit hasn't seen much of the strike yet, but makes that one count, a bit flatter from Curran, right into his arc on the full length ENDSTART0 START1 START2 clattered hard, but not hard enough! Whistles through the covers, but not quite with the necessary elevation! END START0 START1 START2 crashed high over the covers! Bissects the fielders for another boundary, got under the shot slightly, but picked the gap... it dribbles over the rope. Huge over for England! END START0 START1 START2 full toss, slapped through the covers! Tremendous drilled drive, fast hands to capitalise on a rare bad ball... it's still on! END START0 START1 START2 that's a pick-up and a half! Pandya spears in the leg-stump yorker, BATTER falls across his crease to force the angle in front of the leg-side sweeper. Top boshing! END START0 START1 START2 top-edged pull, and over fine leg! BATTER loves to lamp it, and he doesn't care how they come when he throws the bat! END START0 START1 START2 short, and nailed behind square! Poor ball from Pandya, banged in short but leg-sided, BATTER swivels well, hitting down on his stroke, clean past the sweeper! END START0 START1 START2 crunched through long-off! England are self-evidently on the ropes, but they are still swinging into their punches.... BATTER drills the length very straight, and beats the sweeper END START0 START1 START2 back of a length, and slapped lustily through wide long-on! BATTER hasn't given up either... END START0 START1 START2 flogged down the ground, and dropped by Hardik again! Another sitter, in front of the sightscreen, as BATTER fails to pick the slower ball, and hes spilled it into the ropes as well. Oops! END START0 START1 START2 down the leg-side, and that's a fine pull, in every sense. Inside the line, deflected through fine leg, past the flat-footed keeper END START0 START1 START2 wow, that's a lovely strike! On the back foot, pinged from a full length with lots of bottom hand, straight through the V at long-on! END START0 START1 START2 short, sits up, Moeen swings into a pull behind square! Close to the boundary rider, but safe enough. A rare freebie! END START0 START1 START2 too short and wide, clattered in front of third man! Every little helps. BOWLER's leaky day continues, but he is a wicket-taker... END START0 START1 START2 BOWLER flings another short ball down leg with fine leg inside the circle. Moeen simply helps it away past Gill there END START0 START1 START2 banged in short and quick outside off, BATTER takes it on with a pull and swats it past midwicket. He reaches his maiden ODI fifty END START0 START1 START2 BATTER has kept third man busy all evening. Short and wide, he gets on top of the bounce, cracks it away to the right of point and left of deep third man. Make that three fours in four balls END START0 START1 START2 overpitched and outside off, caressed through the line. BATTER leans into it and drives it straight of mid-off. Sweet as... END START0 START1 START2 BATTER is so very strong on the leg side. He shimmies out, takes a full ball from just outside off and whips it fiercely behind square, between the two men in the deep END START0 START1 START2 chest-high short ball, angling into the body, BATTER follows the rousing on-drive with a rasping pull in front of square END START0 START1 START2 much fuller and on the stumps, BATTER unfurls a delightful on-drive, finding the gap between midwicket and mid-on END START0 START1 START2 dug in short and angling across him, BATTER leans back and cuts uppishly over backward point END START0 START1 START2 attempted cutter, short and wide, this long-hop is duly carted away to the cover fence, beating the sweeper's slide END START0 START1 START2 eased sweetly through the covers! He missed out on a full toss in the last over, but this time BATTER's drive fillets the gap to excellent effect END START0 START1 START2 more width, clubbed through point! That was close to the fielder, but it was also travelling, that habitually open face fizzes the ball to the rope! END START0 START1 START2 sweetly timed off the back foot! That's been BATTER's go-to shot so far, but this time he adds power to the open-faced glide, in front of third man. The ball zips across the increasingly dewy outfield, which will you suspect play some part END START0 START1 START2 BATTER's best shot so far. Fuller length, and a crushing drive from BATTER, all about the weight transfer, through the shot, through the covers END START0 START1 START2 pumped through long-off! Power and timing again, looked like he was lining up the cut, but aimed a lot straighter on impact, and there's no intercepting that! END START0 START1 START2 clattered past backward point! The catcher was briefly in business, but he threw his hands hard at that one, wide of off stump, and cuffed it to the rope! END START0 START1 START2 jeepers, that's power and timing! Nothing wrong with that ball, full and angling back into the stumps, but BATTER pounds through his drive, hitting up into the ball, high over the on-side! END START0 START1 START2 two slips in place, but that's too wide to take the edge! A half-tracker outside off, and BATTER needs only to get a toe-end on his cut to rush that through the infield to the cover boundary END START0 START1 START2 curling into the pads, and clipped with sublime timing through square leg! Outstanding from BATTER, timing over power in each instance, and filleting the gaps in the Powerplay END START0 START1 START2 inswinger, belted back down the ground! Well now, that's set the tone! Clubbed with a closing bat face through long-off END START0 START1 START2 hard-handed stab, and that's nailed through the covers! That looked oddly tentative, not sure which way the ball was swinging, but watched it hard, and utterly pinged it! END START0 START1 START2 another slower ball, 115ks, on the pads, but the length is too full with mid-on and mid-off up. Whipped away stylishly to the right of mid-on for four END START0 START1 START2 overpitched and outside off, drilled away past extra-cover, beating sweeper to his right END START0 START1 START2 back of a length and attached with width, possibly a cutter from Curran. Yes, offcutter, BATTER sashes it away to the left of short third man for four END START0 START1 START2 scythed away to the third-man fence. Pandya allows the short ball to come to him outside off, leans back, and chops it away between short third man and point END START0 START1 START2 slower, shorter and banged down the leg side from left-arm around with fine leg inside the circle. BATTER simply helps it away fine of that infielder END START0 START1 START2 on a length and Curran brings this back into BATTER, he uses the angle to his advantage and shovels it away wide of midwicket, pinging the fence END START0 START1 START2 poor ball, fine shot! Too short and wide, and Pandya's hands are so quick through the ball, hitting down on the stroke END START0 START1 START2 clobbered through point! Not timed as well as some, but placed well wide of the sweeper, and that's another four to the score END START0 START1 START2 pounded with violence through the covers! This is the man India are after! Flatter delivery, flatter response, monstered along the turf! END START0 START1 START2 Scooped! Super scooper, high over the shoulder to disrupt a perfectly decent delivery END START0 START1 START2 flicked contemptuously off the legs! Who needs footwork when you have eyes like a hawk and wrists of steel! Pinged high over midwicket, there's a man lurking out there, but he can't get close! One bounce over the rope END START0 START1 START2 a drag-down to launch BATTER's innings, that's a ropey start from BOWLER, and he's livid with himself. Swatted through square leg END START0 START1 START2 BATTER gets on top of short ball outside off and crunnnnnnches a cut to the right of point and left of deep third man END START0 START1 START2 half-tracker outside off, BATTER jumps deep into the crease and hauls it away to the midwicket fence, notching up a 44-ball fifty - his second half-century this series END START0 START1 START2 short, wide, not too dissimilar to the ball that got Rohit in the first ODI. This time he reaches it, gets on top of it, and flays it away to the right of deep third man END START0 START1 START2 on a length, kicks up and moves away outside off, Rohit opens the bat-face and glides it away fine of deep third man END START0 START1 START2 hip-high short ball outside off, 133ks, BATTER lines it up and swats it away with the angle to the right of Livingstone sweeping the leg-side boundary END START0 START1 START2 shortish and outside off, helped down to deep third man END START0 START1 START2 Fifty up for India in 8 overs. BOWLER floats a middle-stump full-toss, duly put away to the midwicket boundary. The man in the deep is squarer END START0 START1 START2 laced through the line! On a length and outside off, punchily driven between mid-off and short cover with a high elbow END START0 START1 START2 back of a length and sliding into the hips, duly tucked away to the left of deep square leg for four END START0 START1 START2 BATTER goes over the top again. On a length and outside off, BATTER camps back and ends up chipping it over short cover END START0 START1 START2 short, wide, scythed away along the ground this time. BATTER jumps, gets on top of it, and puts it away in the off-side gap END START0 START1 START2 short, wide, surely wider than a set of stumps outside off. BATTER reaches out for the ball, scythes it past the outstretched left hand of the man leaping at cover-point END START0 START1 START2 back-to-back fours for Rohit. Even fuller and ends up straying on the pads, Rohit brings his wrists into play and flicks it away to the midwicket fence END START0 START1 START2 Rohit hits over the top, pumping this full ball over mid-off. This is not a half-volley, Rohit stretches out, frees his arms, and collects four END START0 START1 START2 full inswinger from BOWLER, but he ends up shoving it down the leg side, BATTER tickles it away so very fine for four END START0 START1 START2 shot, Rohit! A touch too full and outside off, Rohit isn't fully forward but opens the bat-face to pick the gap between short cover and mid-off. Caressed away ENDSTART0 START1 START2 on the back foot, open-faced drive, supremely timed through backward point!. That's an ODI debut fifty for BATTER, and a hugely impressive arrival END START0 START1 START2 picks up the length early, and thumped through midwicket! Gorgeous hit, standing tall on the back foot, and rifling his hands through the stroke END START0 START1 START2 battered through the covers! That's BATTER's shot ... the one with which he's risen to become the leading T20I batter in the world. Sitting up outside off, and wristily flogged to the rope END START0 START1 START2 nutmegged on the reverse sweep, and BATTER has his fifty! Inside-edged through the keeper's legs. The senior pro comes up with the goods END START0 START1 START2 on a length, BATTER is deep in his crease and effortlessly clips through square leg for four! Pure timing, just nudged away through the gap and it races away to the rope, tantalisingly out of the fielder's reach END START0 START1 START2 short and wide, and BATTER flays a cut away through point for four more! Disdainful shot, with a real flourish away through the off side. 87mph/140kph END START0 START1 START2 straight length ball, whipped elegantly through midwicket! 87mph/140kph from Rauf, straying slightly too straight, and an effortless roll of the wrists to work through the leg side END START0 START1 START2 shimmies down, and clears mid-on! Not out of the middle as he swung across the line, but with mid-on up inside the ring, his boundary was effectively the 30-yard circle END START0 START1 START2 a little shuffle down from BATTER, and Shaheen angles a full one into his pads. Lovely wristy flick through square leg to pick up four more END START0 START1 START2 short ball, pulled away through square leg! Took his eye off the ball momentarily as it got big on him, but he manages to swat it away off the grille END START0 START1 START2 length ball, and BATTER gets forward to drive sweetly through the covers! Lovely shot, high front elbow, slightly open face, and just a push forward through the gap. Classy shot END START0 START1 START2 in the slot outside off, and BATTER times beautifully through point for four more! No real swing, so BATTER simply opens the face, and square-drives through the gap END START0 START1 START2 back of a length, punched exquisitely off the back foot through cover point! Superb shot. Rides the bounce, using the hint of width to free his arms, cutting away through the gap END START0 START1 START2 length ball, driven sweetly through extra cover! 85mph/137kph, angling in, but enough width for BATTER to lean into the drive END START0 START1 START2 length ball outside off, and Salt's eyes light up at a hint of width! Fast hands, crunching it on the up through extra cover for his first boundary END START0 START1 START2 wide outside off, flashed uppishly through the ring! Enough width for BATTER to throw his hands, and he cuts it over short cover and away for four END START0 START1 START2 clears the front leg, and swipes BOWLER over mid-on! 85mph/137kph, in the slot, and Shaheen slogs him over mid-on, up inside the circle END START0 START1 START2 a slap over the leg side, and dropped by Malan at deep midwicket! He made good ground, but couldn't cling on as he dived, and palmed it over the rope for good measure too END START0 START1 START2 tremendous strike! Opens his stance, lovely clean lines on his leg-sided drive, clean through wide long-on END START0 START1 START2 punched down the ground for four. Much more like it. Slightly fuller length, and BATTER presents a full face. Short straight boundary, so this flies away END START0 START1 START2 ooft, superb shot. BOWLER hits 90mph/145kph but it's a bit of a half-volley, and Fakhar drives compactly back past the bowler. Through mid-off, no real foot movement but a vertical bat. Just a punch, really END START0 START1 START2 banged in short, and Fakhar latches onto the pull, nailing it through midwicket. 79mph from BOWLER, and it sits up so nicely for Fakhar, who swivels and drags it from outside off, through the leg side END START0 START1 START2 back of a length at 80mph/128kph, and Fakhar nails the pull! Banged in halfway down, but not enough bounce, and Fakhar watches it sit up, then swivels with fast hands END START0 START1 START2 wide on the crease, full length, and Fakhar thumps him through wide mid-off for four more! Bit of a half-volley, and Fakhar presents a full face, driving firmly through the gap END START0 START1 START2 overpitched outside off, and Fakhar isn't in the mood to mess about. No real foot movement, but frees his arms to hit the gap between mid-off and extra cover END START0 START1 START2 full on the pads, clipped away past Overton at square leg and away for four! BATTER off the mark in ODIs. Gets across towards the off side, as he has throughout the start to his innings, and flicks elegantly away END START0 START1 START2 inside-edged away for four! BOWLER is all over Pakistan's top order here. Back of a length, and BATTER gets into a muddle trying to punch off the back foot. It squirts away via the inside edge, past the diving Simpson's left hand and down to fine leg END START0 START1 START2 shot! BATTER's second boundary, and much more to like with this one. Just a hint of width from a length, and BATTER throws his hands through the line, thumping it out to cover through the gap in the ring END START0 START1 START2 overpitched, and slashed through the cordon for four to get Pakistan up and running. Very full, and it flew away past the diving third slip, all along the floor ENDSTART0 START1 START2 and BATTER brings up fifty with a smart, though not entirely controlled shot. Short ball outside off, steep bounce, and he attempts the uppercut and gets a thick edge that ends up too fine for third man to cut off END START0 START1 START2 shot. Back of a length close to off stump, and BATTER leans away to create a bit of room for his arms, and punches it with a straight bat between backward point and extra-cover END START0 START1 START2 lovely shot. Full outside off, and he leans into the ball and opens his bat face to stroke it between cover and mid-off END START0 START1 START2 this time it's in the slot! Hasan winds up for the wipe over wide long-on, one bounce into the rope END START0 START1 START2 shot, pulled, top-edge, and inches over Simpson's outstretched glove! Always eluding him that time END START0 START1 START2 slashing drive, eludes the diving slip! Crawley is tall, but not that tall... END START0 START1 START2 a touch too full, into the pads, and plinked through wide long-on END START0 START1 START2 width, and lovely timing, placed through backward point, using BOWLER's pace against him END START0 START1 START2 pinged off the pads through wide long-on, that's up the hill but excellently timed END START0 START1 START2 back of a length, angling in towards off stump, and that's nicely played. The fielder at long leg is more a deep backward square leg, so he can't cut off this neat little leg glance. Just got across his stumps and tucked it away fine END START0 START1 START2 super timing. Length ball on off stump, and he simply meets it with a full face and sends it running away to the left of mid-on, who puts in a big effort to chase back but can't stop the boundary END START0 START1 START2 what a shot. Full, angling in towards off stump, and he simply meets it with a full face and sends the ball running away past the non-striker, to the left of mid-on END START0 START1 START2 and he delivers up a genuine free-hit ball. Short, sits up outside off, and Babar hoicks it away over midwicket END START0 START1 START2 full, wide, and there are three slips waiting for the edge but it's full enough for Babar to play an attacking shot away from his body, driven uppishly but into the gap to the right of backward point END START0 START1 START2 low full toss, and Saqib nails that down the slope, wide of mid-on! END START0 START1 START2 inside-edge on the yorker! Clean through fine leg. Precious runs! END START0 START1 START2 poor ball, short and leg-sided, BATTER swivels into his pull, and deflects that through backward square END START0 START1 START2 powerful flog through midwicket! Outstanding response, picking the length early, not especially short, but he's deep in his crease and oodles of time to pound the pull in front of square END START0 START1 START2 flicked off the legs, and that's excellently timed, up the hill. The partnership inches towards 50, and England are regrouping well END START0 START1 START2 back of a length, outside off, doesn't pick that one as it slides straight on, and a low edge past the keeper and slip END START0 START1 START2 short, wide, and BATTER loves width. Stands tall again and crashes it away through cover point, with an angled bat and a full, flowing fullow-through END START0 START1 START2 shot! Tremendous shot! That's a good-length ball outside off stump, and BATTER just stands tall and punches it on the up between extra-cover and cover point END START0 START1 START2 tossed up again, but it's a touch too full and offers width too. Driven confidently to the right of extra-cover END START0 START1 START2 edged, and just out of Rizwan's reach! Length ball in the corridor, doesn't really do that much sideways, but BATTER is only half-forward to defend, and plays inside the line. The edge flies away between the keeper and first slip, inches wide of the diving Rizwan's left glove END START0 START1 START2 now he gets a lot of room to free those arms. Short ball outside off, and he rolls his wrists over to pull it away and beat deep square leg to his right. Kept a bit low, but he adjusted by staying low and bringing his wrists into play END START0 START1 START2 slower, and drifting away from off stump, and the length is perfect for BATTER to unfurl the reverse-sweep and beat backward point to his right END START0 START1 START2 too much width again, a wristy wallop through backward point! And BATTER too has his fifty! The makeshift XI are flying once more! END START0 START1 START2 turned inside-out by a beautiful seamer, and though it's snicked at a catchable height through first slip, there's no catchers in sight, so that's a maiden ODI fifty for the new boy! Outstanding, and it brings up the 100 too END START0 START1 START2 short, top-edged pull, clean through fine leg! It's a shot a minute now! END START0 START1 START2 short, pulled, short of the fielder, four! Cripes, it's all happening, BATTER climbs into the pull, doesn't connect perfectly but deep midwicket can't decide whether to fling himself for the catch or stop the boundary, and manages neither! END START0 START1 START2 too short and wide again! This are freebies to a well-set BATTER Thrashed on the cut through backward point END START0 START1 START2 width again! You can't bowl there. BATTER trusts his hands, trusts the bounce, flogs the boundary through the covers! END START0 START1 START2 short, pulled, four! BATTER reads the length immediately, waits on the back foot, and rifles that through square leg END START0 START1 START2 tremendous batting! Confidently onto the front foot once more, weight coming through the ball on impact, and mid-on's dive can't intercept the boundary! END START0 START1 START2 inside-edge, but they all count! Big nipbacker from BOWLER, seaming into a back-foot punch, and snicking past the keeper, through fine leg END START0 START1 START2 width, walloped! BATTER is enjoying the carry in this deck, the ball coming onto the bat, and coming off it with interest! Clean through the covers END START0 START1 START2 back of a length, slotted through wide long-on! Emphatic from BATTER, trusting his eye, and the bounce, and cracking his way through the in-field END START0 START1 START2 too short, powered through midwicket! Imperious pull shot, deep in the crease but weight going forward, met at the top of the bounce, rolling the wrists. Perfect END START0 START1 START2 glorious! Panned at the top of the bounce, clean through wide long-on. BATTER keeps throwing his punches, and he's up and running now END START0 START1 START2 very wide on the crease, and BATTER responded immediately, stepping way outside leg to exacerbate the angle, and absolutely butchered the cut through point! Top biffing END START0 START1 START2 thrashed out through the covers! Wide enough to free the arms, and few free them better! END START0 START1 START2 bashed fiercely through long-off! Lovely focussed aggression from BATTER, a shimmy to the pitch, and a committed flog through the line END START0 START1 START2 back of a length, and a short-arm pull through midwicket! Solid biffing, unfazed by the previous delivery. Tonked at the top of the bounce END START0 START1 START2 lovely strike, full length, off-stump line, a big stride and a firm face of the bat through the line, past the stumps at the non-striker's end ENDSTART0 START1 START2 full length, open-faced drive through wide long-off! And England have pulled off a record chase at Edgbaston to seal a 3-0 series sweep! END START0 START1 START2 too short, clobbered through midwicket! Huge blow, and that really puts England in command. Solid base, good eye, strong levers! END START0 START1 START2 short, and swung superbly through backward square! BATTER is marching ever onwards END START0 START1 START2 launched through the leg side and BATTER has his hundred! Another final-ball four, and the most cathartic of BATTER's career! Hurtles past the floundering fielder at square leg, and he is rightly ecstatic! What an innings! END START0 START1 START2 terrible drag-down! Short, leg-sided, all BATTER needs to do to flick a splinter of bat on that, clean through fine leg. Another last-ball four, and that's helped England's cause END START0 START1 START2 crushed to the fence, through the covers! Sublime ball-striking, a skip to the pitch, open stance, hands crashing through the square drive END START0 START1 START2 dragged from outside off, and that's rushed to the rope! The sweeper scampers but can't get close. Timing and power on the slog-sweep, and England press onwards END START0 START1 START2 Pakistan leak the boundary again! Excellent from BATTER, a baseball swing around the hips, picking up the length early and pummelling the slower ball through midwicket END START0 START1 START2 too short, and clawed through wide long-on! Bad ball, needed to get out of that over without a boundary, but there was too much width too, and freedom for BATTER's levers END START0 START1 START2 outstanding timing! Expertly shovelled through the leg side, right under the eyes on impact and pinging through midwicket END START0 START1 START2 Two in two! This one was flashier, but still fairly risk free. Backward point thought he was in with a chance, but BATTER had enough air on that to not worry much about Imam END START0 START1 START2 misses his line by a bit, and BATTER latches onto it and cuts it fine of backward point. He played it late and placed it perfectly. Absolutely regal END START0 START1 START2 starts this over off with a boundary. There was flight but it was overpitched, and BATTER transfers his weight beautifully to smash that past extra cover END START0 START1 START2 long hop, rare poor delivery. BATTER won't miss out on that. Picks up four with a pull shot to cow corner END START0 START1 START2 short and wide. Just because a wicket's fallen at the other end won't prevent BATTER from carving this one through backward point. England just keep coming at you END START0 START1 START2 classy stroke from BATTER Opens the bat face ever so slightly to beat point while keeping it away from third man in the deep. Threaded the needle, and picked up four END START0 START1 START2 would you believe it, BATTER has been dropped again! What on earth are they doing? He sent it down to long-on, where, instead of Maqsood getting in position, tried to go after it one-handed. It spills out, because of course it did, and it goes for four END START0 START1 START2 beats mid-off this time. Makes a bit of room this time and carves it past a diving mid-off. Once he was done for, that was four all the way END START0 START1 START2 oh dear, Hasan Ali drops Ben BATTER, and it really is a sitter. Landed on leg stump, with BATTER helping it straight down fine leg's throat, where Hasan Ali spills it END START0 START1 START2 full length, and drilled hard through long-off! BATTER takes the Crawley route, big stride, tight lines, clean full face END START0 START1 START2 back of a length, and butchered through midwicket! BATTER trusts the bounce alright! Back in his crease, hauled from outside off, timing! END START0 START1 START2 timing all the way! Too wide again, BATTER is up on those toes again, caressed past backward point END START0 START1 START2 cracked down on the cut, and pounded through backward point! BATTER seemed to be shaping to pull for a moment, but either way he was up on his toes and well placed to slam another boundary END START0 START1 START2 back of a length, and BATTER seizes the change of length. A couple of steps to the pitch, and whipped around the front leg through midwicket END START0 START1 START2 tremendous pick-up! BATTER is deep in his crease to combat the tight line, and swings into his pull the moment Shaheen loses his length, one bounce into the rope at backward square END START0 START1 START2 gets on top of his cut this time! Enough width to flow into his stroke, hitting down and through third man, and that's a swift outfield too END START0 START1 START2 too short, and plinked off the legs through deep midwicket! No unnecessary power, just placement across the line, as it rolls into the rope END START0 START1 START2 whipped off the legs, and superb timing once more! Clean through backward square END START0 START1 START2 drilled hard down the ground! Emphatic straight drive from BATTER, using his height to stride to the pitch with perfect angles END START0 START1 START2 banged in short, and swung off the hip through backward square! Poor ball, too leg-sided for the field that Pakistan have set, and no-one can cut it off! END START0 START1 START2 outside off, slashed through third man! One bounce and into the boundary hoardings! Pakistan are rattled! END START0 START1 START2 In the slot and this one races to the rope! Those levers are in good order, big stride to the pitch, firm back from a high backlift, too straight through long-off to be stopped END START0 START1 START2 thrashed through point! Imam leaps to his right but can't get close. Kitchen sink through that one! END START0 START1 START2 powerfully flogged through the covers! It's a stiff ask, but BATTER is up for it! Freeing the bottom hand this time, to climb into the length outside up and slash it to the rope END START0 START1 START2 exceptional timing! Full again from Shaheen, the swing is out there somewhere, but BATTER places a broad bat through the line, very straight through long-on, and eludes a futile chase END START0 START1 START2 panned off a good length, over mid-on! Salt's seen enough! Off-stump line, shape into the arc, BATTER peppers the long-on boundary! END START0 START1 START2 doesn't miss out this time! Very full length, looking for the inswing, finding only the slot, nicely opened face to drive through point END START0 START1 START2 starts off with a slog past midwicket that beats the fielder. He's been off strike for a while but doesn't seem to have lost much of his touch END START0 START1 START2 this one's similar to the ball that Hasan Ali managed to streak away for four. It takes a top edge and sails over the keeper's head. These runs will hurt England, it only adds to the pressure END START0 START1 START2 flashes at the first ball, and gets a top edge over Simpson. Can't put a fielder there, and Hasan picks up his first boundary END START0 START1 START2 this time he lay in wait for that short delivery, and hooked it past square leg for four END START0 START1 START2 streaky, but he starts off with a four. Thick outside edge and with the pace the ball had on it, it scuttled past the keeper END START0 START1 START2 extends that by four, slapping BOWLER in front of midwicket. Absolute demolition job this from Babar, doesn't seem like there's a place to bowl to him right now. Just little England can do right now END START0 START1 START2 BATTER with his inconspicuous elegance plays another lovely drive back past the bowler that beats mid-off. Picks up four more END START0 START1 START2 much too far down legside, and BATTER comfortably sweeps this past short fine and pick up a comfortable four END START0 START1 START2 sat up for Babar, and he is dialled in. It was short of a length, and the bottom of Babar's bat dispatched it to the midwicket boundary with fair disdain END START0 START1 START2 races away wide of long-off, concludes another brilliant over for Pakistan. It was a touch short and wide, poor delivery, really, and he had time to pick his spot END START0 START1 START2 helped fine on the legside, got a bit of an edge, but the pace took it to the rope, and takes BATTER to a half-century. He's played second fiddle but that doesn't tell the tale of his innings END START0 START1 START2 in the slot, and away for four. Poor bowling from Saqib because there was no fielder around the wide-long-on region. Rolled his fingers over it and allowed Babar to get into position and clobber him over that very region END START0 START1 START2 punched off the backfoot to the cow corner boundary. Moved across very early and while he didn't get all of it, the placement is good enough to take it to the rope END START0 START1 START2 gets there with the cut shot, and Babar lets off some steam now he's got to his 14th ODI hundred Pakistan have been under pressure, and he's been under pressure, but the Prince of Pakistan cricket wasn't to be kept down for long END START0 START1 START2 this time he finds the gap with the pull in front of square. Not enough pace to worry Babar, and once it beat the man in the circle, deep midwicket didn't have a hope in hell END START0 START1 START2 swiped away through the gap between fine leg and midwicket. Slower ball, I think, but it sat up at chest height for BATTER, and he picked out that gap masterfully END START0 START1 START2 outstanding on-drive! Here comes Pakistan's A game, hurtling down the line like a freight train. A step to the pitch, bat like a pendulum, clean through long-on END START0 START1 START2 too short, too slow, and Babar seized that variation! Crashing down hard on his pull, like a tennis smash in front of square END START0 START1 START2 mid-off is up, so here goes Babar! A stride to the pitch and an inside-out clout over the off side END START0 START1 START2 proper connection this time! In position early, low into the sweep, and the resonant click of willow confirmed that was four all the way END START0 START1 START2 crunched through the gap behind square! Quick hands into the pull as BOWLER bangs it in once more. Excellent placement END START0 START1 START2 flashed off the back foot, clean through the vacant slip! A genuine nick, but he threw his hands at the lifter outside off, largely with impunity. Opportunistic END START0 START1 START2 thrashed through the line! In the air for a long while, but Stokes at mid-off is flat-footed and has no chance of cutting that off END START0 START1 START2 short, and slammed in front of square! Babar shows his class there, all the time in the world to set his weight, and wang his wrists through the pull END START0 START1 START2 dispatched with a glorious wristy drive! Clean through extra cover, bend of the knee, transfer of the weight, sonic-boomed to the rope! END START0 START1 START2 worked into the onside nicely and he gets another boundary Anything tailing down and he's quick to take advantage END START0 START1 START2 pulled away, and it beats the fine leg fielder Loose delivery to end with, short and at a nice height for Imam to swivel-pull square of the man in the deep END START0 START1 START2 strays down leg side, and Babar picks it up and works it through midwicket for a boundary. He finally gets off strike after 15 deliveries, and he has to ensure it's not another 15 before he gets his next run END START0 START1 START2 soon as I say that, that wretched run finally ends. Not convincingly, though. Thick outside edge that flies over the slips to third man. Saqib Mahmood failed to cut it off, and that's a fifth boundary for Imam END START0 START1 START2 this ones slightly short and slightly wide, allowing Imam to get into position and slash it past backward point. He appeared to get a hand on it, but couldn't take the pace off it and prevent it going for four END START0 START1 START2 too full, too straight, and for the third time this innings, Imam picks off the bowler with a clip to midwicket. He's timing these well, and like the others, it races away to the boundary END START0 START1 START2 gets a nick as the ball runs down to third man. Parkinson drives to his right to parry the ball away. It's a bit of a clumsy effort and his foot's touching the line when he makes contact with the ball. Fakhar has a boundary END START0 START1 START2 repeat of the first delivery this time. Much too straight from BOWLER, and the bat comes down and across and works him away to the midwicket boundary once more END START0 START1 START2 nice, confident shot. Loose delivery outside leg stump, and he flicks it away to midwicket for Pakistan's first boundary. They're off and away END
