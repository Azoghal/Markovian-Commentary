START1 START2 START3 Full toss, flogged through mid-on, that'll do it! BATTER mops up the resistance to put England 1-0 up. Wonder if anyone's managed similar in the football yet... END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 climbs into the drive, and the intent burgles him a boundary, off a fat edge through the vacant slip. He'll take that, even if he was aiming about 100 degrees further into the covers END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in short, and it doesn't really get up off the pitch. BATTER swivel-pulls, and Praveen, running round from deep backward square, tries to palm it to Asalanka, running round from long leg, but makes a hash of it, and deflects it into the rope! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 short ball, and Moeen nails the pull through midwicket! Sat up nicely off the pitch at fairly gentle pace, and Moeen swung hard through the line with a full flow, pulling hard in front of square END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 straighter bat this time, and an elegant cover drive! That's better from BATTER, this time he can play the angles as he sees fit, head over the ball and weight flowing through it END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 the clobbering continues! Killed softly by BATTER, an over-pitch into the toes, and lovely delicate timing through midwicket END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 BATTER's had enough of the respect, a gallop to the pitch this time, and a dragged slog through midwicket. Inelegant but effective END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 too short, too wide, that's a rank delivery, and it is duly slotted through the covers, a cut at the top of the bounce. Easy pickings END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, wide line, slammed with disdain through third man! Attempted cutter, but just comes out as oodles of time for YJB to pick his spot END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 over-pitched slower ball, and that is manhandled through long-on! Cripes, Jonny's in a mood today. He really, really doesn't want to miss kick-off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 exquisite from BATTER He's so effortlessly violent through the covers, the full arc from point to mid-off is his. This time he aims square as Binura over-pitches and nails it to the rope END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 stunning from BATTER Up on the toes, just back of the length, and drilled at the top of the bounce through wide long-off! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 overpitched on a full length, and BATTER's open-faced push pings through extra cover! That's a promising start for a batter who likes the ball coming onto the bat END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball on middle stump, whipped wristily through midwicket! My goodness. What a shot from the No. 11! Shades of Pietersen, rolling the wrists nonchalantly and timing the ball into the gap END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 bosh! BATTER has had enough of blocking, and decided to bring out the long handle. Floaty length from Curran outside off, and he dongs him back over his head for four. END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pumped to the ropes once more! The elevated route over the covers this time, up and under on a good length... 'That's close, Dilly..." says Bairstow. Close to what, I'm not sure... END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 c-r-u-n-c-h-e-d through the covers! That's exceptional hitting, a touch inside-out, seizing on the tossed-up delivery, waiting for it to dip into his arc. Thump END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tossed up above the eyeline, and lamped through the line! Straight as you like, over the bowler's head and away to the rope. He's taken full toll of BOWLER today END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 cracked off the front foot! That's a tremendous authoritative strike, a punch off a good length, a hint of width to free the arms, but the bounce is true and so is the shot END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 down on one knee, slog-swept very firmly out to deep midwicket, where Willey slides over the ball! Travelling quickly, but could have done better END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 picks the googly well, drops to one knee, and dumps it hard through long-on. Excellent hard hitting END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 punched away with an open face through point, and Billings can't cut it off running back. First boundary for the rockstar. No foot movement, but opened the face nicely, finding the gap between point and cover point in the infield END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 thrashes at Wood's first ball, which comes down at 89mph, and gets a thickish outside edge down to third for four! Would have gone just over second slip, but there isn't one there. END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 squeezed away through backward point for four more! KJP is on one here. Full and swinging away, and this is a touch of class. Opens the face, piercing the gap between backward point and short third END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 width outside off, and KJP throws his hands at it. Half-stopped at point by Livingstone, diving to his right, but he can only slow it down on its way to the rope, and Billings can't cut it off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 thick inside-edge, past off stump, and past the diving Bairstow on the half-volley! Living dangerously END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 shapes away from the left-hander, but a gentle pace and length, and BATTER laces it through cover-point for four more! Small press forward, and Kusal drills it past short cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 short, wide, cut away for four! 78mph/126kph freebie, dug into the pitch, and BATTER throws his hands at it, lofting up and over cover point END1 END2 END3START1 START2 START3 short ball swung away on the pull, and the misfield at deep backward square ensures this will be the winning hit! England home by eight wickets, a stroll in Sarf Lahndan wraps up some more WC Super League points END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 drilled through the covers! The chase has been pootling towards its conclusion, and that shot sees them almost there END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 Boshed! Short ball, but it doesn't get up enough to trouble BATTER, who swings it in front of deep square END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 short ball tucked off the hip, that will trickle away fine! Just a touch and away it scoots to the rope, fielder won't get round END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 creamed through the covers! Pitched up on the slot and BATTER greases a drive to the rope END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 brings out the reverse-sweep, nailing it past the man at slip, and beating backward point to his right! Asalanka dived to his right, but it burst through his hands END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full, angling in towards off stump, and BATTER effortlessly flicks through midwicket. Played somewhat across the line but expertly picked the gap, rolling the wrists and picking up four more END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 skips down and gives himself room outside leg stump, flashing at the cut and nailing it up and over point for four! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 top-edges the pull... over KJP's head for four! Gets up much more this time, speared in halfway down, and it got big on BATTER He was late on the pull, and it flew up and over the keeper END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pulled firmly off the hip, and Asalanka can't get round to his right to cut it off! Banged in short, but doesn't get up much, and BATTER's timing is spot on END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 speared in full on the pads, and flicked down to long leg. Asitha does brilliantly to dive to his right and save two runs. The TV umpire will check this... and it's four! Asitha was over-zealous in his attempts to pick it up and get the throw in, and was still in contact with the rope at the time END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 flashes at one wide outside off, and just beats that man catching at gully! Length ball, BATTER gets across to cut, and it flies to the left of the man in tight, DdS END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 half-volley on off stump, lashed away through extra cover! Angled across him, but plenty of width, and BATTER's fast hands take over on the drive END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 much cleaner this time! One bounce, lashed over the umpire's head, and over the rope. Full wrong 'un from BOWLER, bit of a half-volley, and BATTER takes a big stride to thump it down the ground END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 skips down the track to drag BOWLER up and over midwicket. Googly, which BATTER didn't seem to pick, but he met the ball on the half-volley and found the gap in the deep END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 very full, YJB nearly yorks himself! Makes room and swings hard, gets a thick inside edge low past the keeper for four! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 slogged over the leg side, gets a good chunk of Asitha's slower ball. Legcutter, I think. Slapped, regardless END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 whump, there it is! Slightly overpitched and BATTER is quickly forward to thrash through the line, dispatching the ball with a crack through extra cover. He finally gets one away END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 crrrrrrrrrrrunched! Checks the hands but still sends it whistling through point, too much width this time and he cashes that cheque END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 scooped off the pads, Chameera can only tip it for four! Binura has fine leg and deep backward square out, but BATTER got it in between them both END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 that's how you do it, Jonny, no need to overhit them, BATTER coming forwards and easing a punch through midwicket for four1 END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 punched back past the bowler, this is going to run fine of mid-off, too... and Chameera's slide then takes him into contact with the rope before he let go of the ball, so it'll be four despite his efforts END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 whisked off the pads through backward square! Casually flicked to a vacant part of the field, runs away to the shortest boundary END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 laced through the covers! Floaty full ball on a tempting wide line and BATTER launches into a cover drive. Hold the pose END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 rammed off the pads in front of square! Poor ball from BOWLER, full and straight at 87mph/140kph and BATTER just whips the hands through END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball outside off, BATTER jumps out and throws the hands, phat inside edge through midwicket... runs away to the rope! BATTER lost his shape completely there, but still picked up four END1 END2 END3START1 START2 START3 battered off the front foot, beats Morgan in the covers for a welcome boundary! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full toss, and blatted through backward point! BOWLER is struggling to grip the ball this time. Loose resumption END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tossed up and thumped through the covers. That's a tidy restart END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 steered through point first ball! Hanging back, playing well away but he gets a good connection. Seems Roy waved it by at backward point, thinking there was a sweeper out there! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 scooped high over square leg, gets a good chunk of it and the ball bounces just in front of the rope, skips away for four! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 battered off the front foot, beats Morgan in the covers for a welcome boundary! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full toss, and blatted through backward point! BOWLER is struggling to grip the ball this time. Loose resumption END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tossed up and thumped through the covers.

END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 scooped high over square leg, gets a good chunk of it and the ball bounces just in front of the rope, skips away for four! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 smashed through the leg side! Dug in short by BOWLER and BATTER moves across his stumps, larrups it for four END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 clubbed off the back foot, that's a firm strike, and excellently timed. Enough width to seize upon, and a despairing slide at wide long-off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 eased off the front foot, clean through the covers! Just skids onto the bat, and all it takes is timing and placement. Easy when you know how END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 up on the toes, and that's elegant! Width outside off, rising into the shot with sweet timing, clean through point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tailing into the legs, and helped through fine leg. Slightly misdirected first-up END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 clattered through the covers, get some of that! Proper intent from the outset, meeting the big outswinger with a full flow of the bat END1 END2 END3
