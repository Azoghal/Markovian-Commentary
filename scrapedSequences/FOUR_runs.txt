The chase has been pootling towards its conclusion, and that shot sees them almost there END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 Boshed! Short ball, but it doesn't get up enough to trouble BATTER, who swings it in front of deep square END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 short ball tucked off the hip, that will trickle away fine! Just a touch and away it scoots to the rope, fielder won't get round END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 creamed through the covers!

Banged in short, but doesn't get up much, and BATTER's timing is spot on END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 speared in full on the pads, and flicked down to long leg. Asitha does brilliantly to dive to his right and save two runs. The TV umpire will check this... and it's four!

Makes room and swings hard, gets a thick inside edge low past the keeper for four! END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 slogged over the leg side, gets a good chunk of Asitha's slower ball. Legcutter, I think. Slapped, regardless END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 whump, there it is! Slightly overpitched and BATTER is quickly forward to thrash through the line, dispatching the ball with a crack through extra cover. He finally gets one away END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 crrrrrrrrrrrunched! Checks the hands but still sends it whistling through point, too much width this time and he cashes that cheque END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 scooped off the pads, Chameera can only tip it for four! Binura has fine leg and deep backward square out, but BATTER got it in between them both END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 that's how you do it, Jonny, no need to overhit them, BATTER coming forwards and easing a punch through midwicket for four1 END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 punched back past the bowler, this is going to run fine of mid-off, too... and Chameera's slide then takes him into contact with the rope before he let go of the ball, so it'll be four despite his efforts END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 whisked off the pads through backward square! Casually flicked to a vacant part of the field, runs away to the shortest boundary END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 laced through the covers!

BATTER lost his shape completely there, but still picked up four END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 wide outside off, and Binura flashes at the slower ball, chipping it just over Roy's head at backward point! All the luck is falling to Sam rather than Tom. Top-edged, and Roy flung himself back, but couldn't get a finger-tip on it! END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 slower ball from wide on the crease which deceives Binura, but his inside-edge will race away for four! Back-of-the-hander, and Binura had no idea where this was going, but gets a slice of luck and picks up four END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 wide on the crease, BATTER gets down on one knee to loft Curran up and over extra cover!

Slower ball again, and DdS sits deep in his crease waiting for it out the back of the hand. Mid-off was up inside the ring, so he just needed enough on it to clear him END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 uppercut down to third man! Cleverly done by BATTER, realising that the fielder had just come up into the ring, he rocked back and flicked the wrists to send the bouncer flying towards the rope END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 picks the slower variety and clouts over midwicket! BATTER gets hold of his pull and collects four END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 full and slightly leg side, BATTER is across, deftly paddles this fine!

Cutter from BOWLER and DdS just waits on it, angles the face, and guides behind square END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 drilled through the covers! Slower ball from Curran, a cutter wide of off stump, but he's seeing it well and smears four. Doesn't need to move END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 dug in short, sits up nicely, BATTER whumps it up and over midwicket! Too powder puff from Curran and he's collared on the pull, high and handsome into the outfield END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 ooft, lovely shot through mid-off again. Lovely timing. Straighter this time, past Wood's left hand as he dived in his follow-through, then past Willey's right at mid-off.

What a shot this is. Back of a length from BOWLER, and DDS unfurls a back-foot punch, holding the pose as it races past backward point and away to the rope END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 banged in halfway down, and nails another pull through straight midwicket! Full-blooded shot, rocking onto the back foot, and DDS has had enough of knocking it around, putting a dent in Curran's figures END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 banged in halfway down, and DDS pulls hard through midwicket for four! 78mph/126kph from Curran, gentle pace, and BATTER latches onto the pull, past the man in tight END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 full and straight, and DDS tonks BOWLER back over his head!

Couple of bounces and over the rope END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 angling in, but a bit of a half-volley, and BATTER creams it through the covers! Great shot.
