The chase has been pootling towards its conclusion, and that shot sees them almost there END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 Boshed! Short ball, but it doesn't get up enough to trouble BATTER, who swings it in front of deep square END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 short ball tucked off the hip, that will trickle away fine! Just a touch and away it scoots to the rope, fielder won't get round END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 creamed through the covers! Pitched up on the slot and BATTER greases a drive to the rope END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 brings out the reverse-sweep, nailing it past the man at slip, and beating backward point to his right! Asalanka dived to his right, but it burst through his hands END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full, angling in towards off stump, and BATTER effortlessly flicks through midwicket.

Gets up much more this time, speared in halfway down, and it got big on BATTER He was late on the pull, and it flew up and over the keeper END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pulled firmly off the hip, and Asalanka can't get round to his right to cut it off! Banged in short, but doesn't get up much, and BATTER's timing is spot on END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 speared in full on the pads, and flicked down to long leg. Asitha does brilliantly to dive to his right and save two runs. The TV umpire will check this... and it's four! Asitha was over-zealous in his attempts to pick it up and get the throw in, and was still in contact with the rope at the time END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 flashes at one wide outside off, and just beats that man catching at gully! Length ball, BATTER gets across to cut, and it flies to the left of the man in tight, DdS END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 half-volley on off stump, lashed away through extra cover!

Googly, which BATTER didn't seem to pick, but he met the ball on the half-volley and found the gap in the deep END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 very full, YJB nearly yorks himself! Makes room and swings hard, gets a thick inside edge low past the keeper for four! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 slogged over the leg side, gets a good chunk of Asitha's slower ball. Legcutter, I think. Slapped, regardless END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 whump, there it is! Slightly overpitched and BATTER is quickly forward to thrash through the line, dispatching the ball with a crack through extra cover. He finally gets one away END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 crrrrrrrrrrrunched! Checks the hands but still sends it whistling through point, too much width this time and he cashes that cheque END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 scooped off the pads, Chameera can only tip it for four! Binura has fine leg and deep backward square out, but BATTER got it in between them both END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 that's how you do it, Jonny, no need to overhit them, BATTER coming forwards and easing a punch through midwicket for four1 END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 punched back past the bowler, this is going to run fine of mid-off, too... and Chameera's slide then takes him into contact with the rope before he let go of the ball, so it'll be four despite his efforts END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 whisked off the pads through backward square! Casually flicked to a vacant part of the field, runs away to the shortest boundary END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 laced through the covers!

BATTER lost his shape completely there, but still picked up four END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 wide outside off, and Binura flashes at the slower ball, chipping it just over Roy's head at backward point! All the luck is falling to Sam rather than Tom. Top-edged, and Roy flung himself back, but couldn't get a finger-tip on it! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 slower ball from wide on the crease which deceives Binura, but his inside-edge will race away for four! Back-of-the-hander, and Binura had no idea where this was going, but gets a slice of luck and picks up four END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 wide on the crease, BATTER gets down on one knee to loft Curran up and over extra cover!

Races away, and beats Root to his right at deep backward square! Nice roll of the wrists, finding the gap between long leg and square leg END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 skips down, and bludgeons BOWLER over long-off!

Length ball outside off, holding its line, and with short third inside the ring, DdS opens the face and steers it to his left END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 clouted up and over mid-off for four! Slower ball again, and DdS sits deep in his crease waiting for it out the back of the hand. Mid-off was up inside the ring, so he just needed enough on it to clear him END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 uppercut down to third man! Cleverly done by BATTER, realising that the fielder had just come up into the ring, he rocked back and flicked the wrists to send the bouncer flying towards the rope END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 picks the slower variety and clouts over midwicket! BATTER gets hold of his pull and collects four END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full and slightly leg side, BATTER is across, deftly paddles this fine!

Cutter from BOWLER and DdS just waits on it, angles the face, and guides behind square END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 drilled through the covers! Slower ball from Curran, a cutter wide of off stump, but he's seeing it well and smears four. Doesn't need to move END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 dug in short, sits up nicely, BATTER whumps it up and over midwicket! Too powder puff from Curran and he's collared on the pull, high and handsome into the outfield END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 ooft, lovely shot through mid-off again. Lovely timing. Straighter this time, past Wood's left hand as he dived in his follow-through, then past Willey's right at mid-off. Compact shot, economy of movement END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 punched through wide mid-off for four! 91mph/146kph, but in the slot, and DDS gets forward to present the face, timing it beautifully past the man in the ring END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 nailed through straight midwicket for four more! DDS is enjoying this pull shot today. Back of a length, enough width to free his arms, and clubbed away into the gap END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 flashed away through cover point! What a shot this is. Back of a length from BOWLER, and DDS unfurls a back-foot punch, holding the pose as it races past backward point and away to the rope END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in halfway down, and nails another pull through straight midwicket! Full-blooded shot, rocking onto the back foot, and DDS has had enough of knocking it around, putting a dent in Curran's figures END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in halfway down, and DDS pulls hard through midwicket for four! 78mph/126kph from Curran, gentle pace, and BATTER latches onto the pull, past the man in tight END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full and straight, and DDS tonks BOWLER back over his head! Some attacking intent. Cleanly-struck, straight down the ground with a full-blooded drive. Couple of bounces and over the rope END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angling in, but a bit of a half-volley, and BATTER creams it through the covers! Great shot. High front elbow, holds the pose in the follow-through. One for the snappers. Sri Lanka up and running END1 END2 END3
