He's not hit the ball in anger but got 12 off two balls END START0 START1 START2 Imperious. There's a long-on in place but he has hit it so well and so straight that it's gone over the boundary - just about - without the man having got anywhere near it. Overpitched on leg stump and he checks his lofted drive again, and once again gets the timing oh so good. END START0 START1 START2 clears Hardik at long-on and BATTER has crossed the 40s to raise a fifty. Thumbs up to his dugout and a wide grin on his face.

A cuffed upper-cut, over third man, and that's his seventh six of the innings! END START0 START1 START2 oof, that was gone from the moment the bat crack was heard! A shuffle across the crease, Curran misses his yorker, and suddenly it's a leg-stump full-toss, pumped high over square leg again! END START0 START1 START2 a one-handed wallop, high over the sightscreen! Good grief, he was nowhere near that, but trusted his eye after belatedly realising he'd been beaten by the slower ball, and that just arcs over long-on! END START0 START1 START2 short, and slammed for a first-ball six over square leg! Eat that! Another first-ball six in this series.... they've been stacking up!

Regally done, full swing of the arms and the ball went over the sightscreen END START0 START1 START2 bang. poor ball and BATTER punishes that. Too short, googly spinning down leg, he goes back and pulls with force to send it over backward square leg. ENDSTART0 START1 START2 pounded in short and wide, and slammed over long-on! BATTER rocks so deep into his crease, belting the cutter as it sits up in the pitch... this is the big over now! END START0 START1 START2 BATTER clears the front dog, and biffs the attempted yorker into the stands! Huge intent, high over long-on. Now then ... is this the do-or-die over for England and BATTER END START0 START1 START2 back of a length, and bludgeoned over cow corner! Sits up, through come the hands, sailing into the stands! END START0 START1 START2 short and outside off, just 130ks, Moeen jumps back and pummels a pull over midwicket.

He clears Kumar in the deep with a slog-sweep END START0 START1 START2 here comes BATTER dashes down the track and clears long-on. It's not easy to step out to BOWLER, he doesn't give the length and time, but BATTER manufactures a six with his power END START0 START1 START2 more zippy extra bounce, and BATTER gets away with a top-edge! That's miles over the boundary, but a win for Krishna! BATTER was in no position for the pull and is lucky he's got a fat edge! END START0 START1 START2 105ks slower full ball outside off, BATTER dashes out of the crease, gets close enough to the pitch, and lifts it over mid-off END START0 START1 START2 BOWLER tests BATTER with a chest-high short ball on middle, he splices a pull over long leg for six END START0 START1 START2 chest-high short ball on middle, BATTER takes it on with a pull and hits it stylishly over long leg for six END START0 START1 START2 half-tracker on middle, sits up to be hit. BATTER obliges, launching a six over midwicket END START0 START1 START2 flighted and outside off, BOWLER tosses it into Pant's swinging arc. Down the track and thumped over the bowler's head for a powerful six. Another wrong'un? Doesn't matter END START0 START1 START2 lots of air this time and that's mowed into the stands! BATTER brings up his latest fifty with a stereotypical smack across the line. That's his slot, and it's slotted once more! END START0 START1 START2 down on one knee and bludgeoned high over midwicket! Moeen's figures are taking a pounding now... it might be time to shelve the spin attack for now... END START0 START1 START2 in the arc again, and whoomphed over the leg side! This is getting rowdy now as Pandya hits with the spin again END START0 START1 START2 BATTER's in the mood now as well! Stands and delivers, a flat crease-bound whack through the line. Not dissimilar to the third of Kapil's four sixes at Lord's 1990... in case you fancy a throwback reference! END START0 START1 START2 here comes BATTER, nowhere near the pitch, but nails it all the same! An offbreak to the leftie, dipping before he could reach it, one hand comes off the bat, and it's way over long-off! END START0 START1 START2 battered over cow corner!

A wonderfully mellifluous crack of willow on the slog-sweep, into the second row! END START0 START1 START2 bouncer, and he's taken it on supremely! A roundhouse hook, grabbed from outside off, no attempt to keep it down as he slams it over backward square! END START0 START1 START2 carted into the stands!

He smashes it over long-on END START0 START1 START2 BOWLER is taking a real pounding now.
