Early call for two, and they cruise back for it END START0 START1 START2 reverse-paddle-swept over the keeper's head. Lakshan gives chase from short third and cuts it off just inside the rope END START0 START1 START2 width outside off stump, and BATTER leans on the cover drive with a high front elbow. Hasaranga, the sweeper, gets round to field END START0 START1 START2 edged between the keeper and gully! Back of a length, good bounce, thick outside edge, and just out of gully's reach to his left! END START0 START1 START2 tighter line, and this time BATTER has the ball right under his eyeline as he deflects to third man, where there's a horrendous hash of a fielding effort. Free runs through his legs END START0 START1 START2 hitting down on the pull again, out to deep midwicket. There's some heat in these deliveries, making the cross-batted strokes awkward END START0 START1 START2 wide on the crease, angled in, clipped to wide long-on, and they take on Moeen Ali in the deep... and get back for two! Not great fielding, but excellent running from this pair END START0 START1 START2 driven uppishly, plinked over Morgan at short cover END START0 START1 START2 back of a length, flipped to square leg as Curran spears it in from round the wicket END START0 START1 START2 gloriously calculated loft down the ground... mid-off is up, so BATTER eases into a languid hoof towards the long-off rope.

Loose drive with no foot movement from BATTER, and Curran induced the edge, angling it across him from a fullish length. Flies up and over Root at slip END START0 START1 START2 wide outside off, slashes away down to third, where Rashid gets round to field on the bounce. Expensive over!

Short extra was briefly interested, but it was never in reach END START0 START1 START2 back of a length, pulled out to deep midwicket. Hasaranga fields, and stops them getting back for three END START0 START1 START2 gets down to reverse-lap over KJP's outstretched left hand, as he shuffles across in anticipation.

Can he lash something together from the flotsam and jetsam of this SL innings? END START0 START1 START2 flicked away through backward square leg, Willey has to run around the rope to cut it off END START0 START1 START2 speared in full at 89mph, nicely played as he shifts the weight forward, crisp straight drive though it won't quite go all the way as Willey hunts it down END START0 START1 START2 classy batting this, waiting for the back-of-a-length ball and dabbing down very late to deep third.

Spins away from a shorter length, smeared away to sweeper cover off the back foot END START0 START1 START2 BOWLER pounds it on a hard length outside off and draws an inside edge to the leg side END START0 START1 START2 flatter but fuller outside off and he moves across to sweep it fine. Bhuvnehswar runs after it and pulls it back END START0 START1 START2 has a big mow across the line now, still no timing, there's a man at deep midwicket to collect END START0 START1 START2 shorter and wide outside off, he hammers it through cover, and it needs another bit of good fielding to stop it. Shreyas Iyer dives to his left to stop it. Uh oh, he's hurt his left shoulder too, making that stop. The ball was travelling at bullet speed past him, got his hand stretched out and dived to his left, managed to slow it's progress considerably. Saved two runs, but he seems to be in a lot of pain. END START0 START1 START2 length ball on the pads, flicked over midwicket. No timing on it, but he clears the in-field. The ball gets pulled in after a chase END START0 START1 START2 lovely shot but Hardik manages to dive to his left at extra cover and keep them to two. Didn't stop it cleanly but took enough pace off that he could get up and collect it. Full outside off and peachy cover drive END START0 START1 START2 two runs off a ricochet of a direct hit. BATTER drove straight to Hardik at extra cover. They were looking for the single and Hardik had a shy. No one backing up END START0 START1 START2 pops in the air but lands safely behind midwicket. Got it towards the end of the bat and also was too early into the shot, so it popped up, but cleared the in-field END START0 START1 START2 back of a length outside off, stands on his toes to punch, gets it off the bottom of the bat but in the gap between cover and extra cover END START0 START1 START2 length straying on the pads, tucked through midwicket for a couple END START0 START1 START2 back of a length on off, makes room and punches through deep cover.

Good through by the fielder in the deep who ruan to his left and forward from long-on but BATTER had judged that second run to a nicety and made it back in time END START0 START1 START2 too short, he goes back and slap this through midwicket. In the gap so comfortable two END START0 START1 START2 on a length and turned off the pads to fine leg, a misfield from Rashid in the outfield allows an extra run END START0 START1 START2 wrong'un, short and spinning in from outside off, slashed past slip down towards third man END START0 START1 START2 BATTER ventures down the track and flicks a straight ball down to long leg END START0 START1 START2 comes down the track again, but this was also on the shorter side so he can only work it off his pads.

END START0 START1 START2 too full on the pads, flicked off his pads through midwicket END START0 START1 START2 too short, sits up and he rocks back to cut fiercely through point. END START0 START1 START2 edged, and low past the keeper! Wide line again, not sure it was a catch, but a clear edge. More runs. Wow END START0 START1 START2 so much width, it would have been given as such if he'd left it. But he's seeing it like a planet now, as he batters hard to the wide long-off boundary's edge END START0 START1 START2 cramped on middle and leg, BATTER jabs the bat through the line to mid-on, and is coasting a little bit as the shy comes in ...oh my! A bit casual with the appeal there too! This is excruciatingly close. The bail is up before the bat is in, but the zing doesn't light up for another couple of frames... is there a splinter of wood over the line... it's debatable! Not out! And I have to say, I think BATTER is very lucky there! END START0 START1 START2 swished off the pads, behind square, Kuldeep scrambles well on the boundary's edge to save the four END START0 START1 START2 belted across the line to deep midwicket, and a good tumbling stop to intercept another boundary END START0 START1 START2 curling into the toes, clipped with superb timing out through midwicket. Good flurry of runs for England right now END START0 START1 START2 a well-weighted clip to the leg-side, but that was a big of a hustle from Bairstow! Kohli had to stretch to gather. Might have been tight with a direct hit from Krunal END START0 START1 START2 width, and BATTER slashes past the keeper! A fat edge, slip would have swallowed it, but that's runs END START0 START1 START2 advancing to the pitch, and nudged to the leg side... that's very hustly running from BATTER, and a better throw might have been tight! Roy was struggling, but BOWLER couldn't gather END START0 START1 START2 fuller and into him, clipped off his toes through midwicket END START0 START1 START2 gets some shape straightaway, as BATTER is pressing forward to this length ball on off. Inside-edged through square leg END START0 START1 START2 On the legs, flicked out to deep midwicket, and India finish on 336 END START0 START1 START2 cracked with intent, high over extra cover! BATTER isn't messing around with the final reckoning looming. Tidied up in the deep. But kudos to Curran, that was a much better over END START0 START1 START2 spliced out to wide long-on, climbing into the wide short ball, but doesn't connect properly END START0 START1 START2 back of alength outside off, stays back and punches with authority through cover. The man on the boundary has to sprint to his right to cut it off END START0 START1 START2 length on the pads, goes back and wrists it through square. END START0 START1 START2 length outside off, goes back and punches through extra cover. Malan at the boundary doesn't gather cleanly and allows a second END START0 START1 START2 fuller on leg stump, comes forward and works it through square with soft hands. The fielders are deep so they get two END START0 START1 START2 closes the face on leg stump, and Sam Curran at fine leg has a long sprint to intercept a gently rolling clip END START0 START1 START2 whipped with power through the leg side. Sweet timing, but Malan is well positioned to intercept a fine stroke END START0 START1 START2 short ball, BATTER reels into the pull, but is beaten for pace as his shot dribbles out to midwicket. But bonus runs as the shy hits the striker's stumps and zips away ENDSTART0 START1 START2 high, hoisted over the leg side off the top edge, three men converge, Natarajan spills it! What is going orf out there! Slower ball, miles in the air to third man... he made a dive, but made a hash of it! END START0 START1 START2 another cutter outside off, short again, thwacked with all of BATTER's mini-might, into the covers, and Wood hustles well to get back for two! END START0 START1 START2 there's the wide cutter, but this time BATTER's wise to it, with a flat-batted smack into space on the off side. He hustles back for the second END START0 START1 START2 flashed high down to long-on, and just short of the fielder! A valiant dive from Rahul, and a good piece of bodywork to save the boundary as the ball dips in front of him END START0 START1 START2 back of a length, panned past Kohli at short cover! So close, and so nearly wrapping that left hand round it again! Hit firmly by BATTER, which saved him END START0 START1 START2 attractive tonk off the front foot from BATTER Can't beat the sweeper, but he comes back for two useful runs END START0 START1 START2 on the legs, flicked very fine, Thakur slides well to keep the ball in play, keeping his limbs away from the rope END START0 START1 START2 flogged off a good length, not quite picking the slower ball, long-on is up, so it's a safe enough shot, plugging over the fielder's head END START0 START1 START2 flicked out to deep midwicket, and good hustling makes two as Krunal has to run around to his left hand to field END START0 START1 START2 punched in the air, inches over short cover! So close! Moeen was on the back foot, stabbing through the ball, and that's flicked his fingertips I think! END START0 START1 START2 back of a length and outside off, stabbed to the left of midwicket off the inner half END START0 START1 START2 BOWLER finds grip and turn, BATTER was lining up to thrash it through the covers, but then checks his stroke and runs it down to deep third man END START0 START1 START2 open face, pressed through the covers, good scampering to come back for the second END START0 START1 START2 full length, curling into the toes, and nurdled to deep midwicket END START0 START1 START2 cracked hard through mid-off, that's sweet timing too, but good relay fielding on the boundary's edge END START0 START1 START2 up on the toes, and cut hard to deep point. BATTER riding the extra bounce well after that unnerving first ball END START0 START1 START2 closing the face on another straight drive, pressed very straight back past the stumps... that's a measured response to Bhuve's each-way threat END START0 START1 START2 back of a length on middle, spliced straight of mid-on END START0 START1 START2 back of a length and outside off, BATTER spots that mid-on is inside the circle, so drags it over that infielder. Stokes chases hard, and keeps it to a double END START0 START1 START2 Rashid runs back from mid-off, gets into a side-on position, and drops this skier. Full on middle, another slower delivery, sliced in the air, and BATTER gets away with it END START0 START1 START2 on a length and outside off, push-driven away to the right of Moeen at mid-off END START0 START1 START2 shortish and angling in towards off, Pandya hauls a pull to the left of deep square leg END START0 START1 START2 full on the pads, whipped away to the right of Livingstone at deep square END START0 START1 START2 clipped through midwicket with the spin.

Rauf doesn't get the old-school shout of "watch the spin!" but manages to dive to his left and cut it off END START0 START1 START2 short, flipped away off the hip for a couple through backward square END START0 START1 START2 squirted away through square leg via the inside half of the bat END START0 START1 START2 length ball, threaded through the gap between cover and extra cover. Babar gets back to field it END START0 START1 START2 length ball, hacked miles up into the air, and Parky spills it running back at mid-on!

Should get back for three but decide against END START0 START1 START2 frees his arms, slashing down to deep third after beating the dive of backward point. Mahmood gets round to his left to cut it off. Opened the face and threw his hands at it ENDSTART0 START1 START2 floated across, wide of off stump again, and he looks to sweep once more.

Hits it in the air but places it well, to the left of third man END START0 START1 START2 length ball on middle and off, clipped away to the right of long leg END START0 START1 START2 back on the stumps, a well-placed flick off the pads, the lack of pace allows them to rush back for the second.

END START0 START1 START2 tickled off the legs, behind square, and there's oodles of space there... huge acclaim for the second run! END START0 START1 START2 bashed high and hard down the ground! A big cheer, but he didn't get hold of that perfectly. Did enough to clear mid-off though, which is all that mattered END START0 START1 START2 picks the googly, flicks a measured pull through the leg side, and BATTER has his maiden ODI fifty. Hell of a time to choose! END START0 START1 START2 flashed up and over the on-side, spanking the length ball out to deep midwicket. Was aiming straighter but dragged it on impact END START0 START1 START2 slower ball, hanging on the back foot, chopped through backward point. Checked his stroke well END START0 START1 START2 slashed off the back foot, one hand comes off the bat as he does so, to deep cover END START0 START1 START2 cracked hard off the back foot, and more hustling between the wickets brings a second as third man has a lot of ground to cover END START0 START1 START2 pulled hard, back of a length, well parried on the boundary as that was travelling hard, but excellent running as the sweeper has to adjust END START0 START1 START2 punched to deep extra and this time they can scamper back for a couple.

People tend to find it funny so long as it's happening to someone else, and it's happened to poor Rizwan. Physio's out END START0 START1 START2 unleashes the reverse sweep. Didn't middle it but got enough on it to evade short third man as the pair hare back for two END START0 START1 START2 a little skip down the track and he turns it round the corner END START0 START1 START2 a bit of spin, driven through the offside END START0 START1 START2 pressed off the legs out to deep midwicket END START0 START1 START2 open-faced glide into the covers END START0 START1 START2 more pleasing timing off the toes, swept up on the rope END START0 START1 START2 back of a length, cracked into the covers, another misfield gifts the single.

Excellent running to capitalise on a sluggish gather at third man END START0 START1 START2 high-elbowed drive, down the ground to long-off END START0 START1 START2 smashed to midwicket. Man in the deep does well to cut it off, and Pakistan come back for a couple. That's it, they end on 331 END START0 START1 START2 pace off to Babar, who helps it to cow corner and comes back for a couple. I'm guessing he wants as many balls as possible now.

Babar manages to make a low full toss of it, and scurry back for two END START0 START1 START2 pace off, almost spun back into him.

The ball almost seemed to have gone past him before he lets the open face get a tickle on it, beating a diving keeper END START0 START1 START2 worked through the offside and he hares back for a second. Few are quicker than BATTER, but he needed the dive. Appeared to have hit his nose on his helmet in the process END START0 START1 START2 helped down to fine leg. Poor delivery, that, and once more it's wide enough of fine leg for Babar to come through END START0 START1 START2 opens the face of the bat slightly and pierces the gap between the in-field and deep cover. The man in the deep does exceptionally well to keep it down to two.
