Lakshan gives chase from short third and cuts it off just inside the rope END START0 START1 START2 width outside off stump, and BATTER leans on the cover drive with a high front elbow. Hasaranga, the sweeper, gets round to field END START0 START1 START2 edged between the keeper and gully! Back of a length, good bounce, thick outside edge, and just out of gully's reach to his left! END START0 START1 START2 tighter line, and this time BATTER has the ball right under his eyeline as he deflects to third man, where there's a horrendous hash of a fielding effort. Free runs through his legs END START0 START1 START2 hitting down on the pull again, out to deep midwicket. There's some heat in these deliveries, making the cross-batted strokes awkward END START0 START1 START2 wide on the crease, angled in, clipped to wide long-on, and they take on Moeen Ali in the deep... and get back for two!
