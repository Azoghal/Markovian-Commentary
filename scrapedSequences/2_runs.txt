START0 START1 START2 START3 full legbreak , and BATTER is deep in the crease to clip out to the leg-side boundary . Early call for two , and they cruise back for it END START0 START1 START2 START3 reverse-paddle-swept over the keeper 's head . FIELDER gives chase from short third and cuts it off just inside the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 width outside off stump , and BATTER leans on the cover drive with a high front elbow . FIELDER , the sweeper , gets round to field END START0 START1 START2 START3 edged between the keeper and gully ! Back of a length , good bounce , thick outside edge , and just out of gully 's reach to his left ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 tighter line , and this time BATTER has the ball right under his eyeline as he deflects to third man , where there 's a horrendous hash of a fielding effort . Free runs through his legs END START0 START1 START2 START3 hitting down on the pull again , out to deep midwicket . There 's some heat in these deliveries , making the cross-batted strokes awkward END START0 START1 START2 START3 wide on the crease , angled in , clipped to wide long-on , and they take on FIELDER in the deep ... and get back for two !

Does n't time it , but the percentage play is top-notch . Sri Lanka going very well now ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 lands in no-man's-land this time on the pull ! Dug in short , hoicked away into the leg side , and plugs behind square , well short of a fielder END START0 START1 START2 START3 mid-off is in the game this time , but BATTER clears him ! Gets the front leg out the way and cross-bats it just over FIELDER , running back from inside the circle END START0 START1 START2 START3 pulled away , out to deep midwicket . They opt to take on FIELDER ' arm this time , and get back comfortably enough END
