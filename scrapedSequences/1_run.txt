Hasan is flinging the bat at everything , and why not END START0 START1 punched off the front foot , down the ground to long-off END START0 START1 banged in short , leaves the periscope up! And disturbs a flock of pigeons at third man as the sweeper tidies up END START0 START1 on the front foot , thumped down the ground to long-off END START0 START1 picked off the legs , and deep midwicket is nearly in the game!

Ends up off-balance , and slices it high towards third man , but it bounces well short of him END START0 START1 shortish on off stump , pulled to deep midwicket END START0 START1 ooh. Not quite full enough to drive though the width was there.

Nailed it to be fair but the sweeper is back END START0 START1 back of a length , more tail into the right-hander , who retreats to leg to dink a cut through point. These are hugely valuable runs END START0 START1 flicked to the on-side , another low full-toss , inswinging into the pads END START0 START1 full again , dug out to the leg side this time. One more to the total END START0 START1 yorker , superb direction , but dug out well to third man END START0 START1 full length , open-faced drive , thick outside-edge to third man.

It 's made the difference between a scramble to 180 all out , and a real shot at a defendable total END START0 START1 tighter line , fuller length , poked to third man. Up 89mph on that occasion END START0 START1 outside off , deflected down to third man , good gap-picking END START0 START1 swishing pull , through backward square END START0 START1 tip and run , a poke to the off-side , and another single to the total END START0 START1 shimmies across the stumps , as BOWLER follows his movement to the off-side , pushed into the covers END START0 START1 nipping back off the pitch , into the thighs and nudged behind square END START0 START1 on the back foot , nudged to the leg side END START0 START1 hops into line to deflect the single to backward square END START0 START1 cracked hard off the back foot , backward point does better this time to cut off the ball END START0 START1 belted off the back foot into the off side , a fumble at point gives away the single END START0 START1 on the back foot , punched into the off side for another single END START0 START1 bottom-handed biff to long-on , tossed up on a good length outside off END START0 START1 another thrashing drive off the front foot , into the covers END START0 START1 shortish , rising over the stumps , hops back and across , rides the bounce , and tucks it away through square leg END START0 START1 back of a length , a bit wider.

Steps a long way across his stumps , and has to bring his bat down quickly in front of his pad to clip that wide of mid-on END START0 START1 full outside off , good stride forward for a crisp push to deep point. Nice way to get your first run in ODIs END START0 START1 short , not a lot of width , but BATTER gets right on top of the bounce and slaps it authoritatively to deep point END START0 START1 length ball angling in towards the stumps , straightening just a touch. Driven to long-off END START0 START1 tossed up , slanting away from off stump , clipped with the turn to long-on END START0 START1 flat , on the pads , nudged into the backward square leg region END START0 START1 similar ball , maybe slanted slightly further away from off stump , and BATTER makes a bit of room to punch it to long-off with a straight bat END START0 START1 short , a bit of width , but that 's okay when you have that sweeper at deep cover point to mop up.

Heroic effort from Imam , flinging himself one-handed to his left , but couldn't close his fingers around the chance. A mistimed cut , and looped a touch towards the committed fielder ENDSTART0 START1 genuine nick as Shaheen digs one into the deck from round the wicket. But it 's another single to third man END START0 START1 back of a length , flicked to the on side , that 's a mighty over for England END START0 START1 open face , fenced past the sprawling backward point , but deep third limits the damage... at least initially , as his return to Sarfaraz is awful!
