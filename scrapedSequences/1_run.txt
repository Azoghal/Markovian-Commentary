END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 offcutter, punched out to the cover sweeper END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 slower-ball bouncer, into the pitch.

"ROOOOT," cry the crowd. Not at his best today, but he churns out 50-over runs for fun END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 width outside off, cut away to deep point. Think about the second, but decide against, so BATTER will be on strike on 49 END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in, Moeen pulls hard out to Hasaranga at deep square. One of the first balls he's middled today END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 steered away to deep third, opening the face END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in short, pulled away to deep backward square where Hasaranga - now wearing a wide-brimmed sunhat, by the way, because why not? - fields END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 punched out to cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in short, Moeen pulls out to deep square END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full on the pads, clipped away to deep square leg END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 extra bounce from a length, punched out to cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full wrong 'un, which Moeen fails to pick again, and squeezes away off the outside edge down towards gully END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, fenced away towards square leg for a quick single END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 top-edged on the hook, and shelled at long leg! BATTER gets a life after Moeen's earlier. Dug in short, and BATTER got into a horrible position, looking to hoick the short ball from outside off stump out into the leg side. Top-edged, Chameera ran in, but couldn't hold on after running in to get his hands underneath it! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball, clipped off the pads through square-ish midwicket END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full legbreak, worked out to long-on for the only run of the over END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 angled in, clipped out to deep square leg END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 punched out to the sweeper at cover point off the back foot END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full on off stump, clipped out to long-on END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 flat on the pads, clipped to long leg END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full on the pads, clipped past short midwicket, out to long-on END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 cut down to third to keep the strike END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full, flat legbreak. BATTER gets deep in his crease, and presses it out to long-on for a single, jamming the bat down late END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full googly, mishit out to cover point as Moeen doesn't pick it out the hand. All along the floor, away for one to bring up the 100 END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 width outside off, cut away to deep third. Think about two, but decide against END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 wide outside off stump, elegant, free-flowing drive out to the cover sweeper END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 dabbed down through third, past the man in the ring on the 45 END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 rides the bounce, clipping a back-of-a-length ball to square leg END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 short and wide, punched out to the sweeper at cover on the back foot END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 googly, worked out to long-on from deep in the crease on the back foot END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full on the pads, clipped away to square leg as BOWLER concedes his first run END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 stabbed with an angled bat, down through third man END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pressed into the covers, working the gaps once more END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back to the chop into the covers, finds enough of a gap to pinch the strike.

END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 cracked on the up out to deep cover END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 flicked off the pads to keep the score ticking END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, leg sided, a swishing pull to rotate the strike END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 chopped to third man END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 better intent on that ball, hitting the deck hard outside off, as BATTER rises into a glide to third man END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 hits the bat hard as BATTER attempts soft hands on the deflection through third man END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 full and straight, tucked to the leg side again, singles aplenty for the moment END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 shaping into the right-hander on a good length, BATTER places bat on ball, letting it come to him in a neutral stance and burgles the single to mid-on END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tapped off the legs, another single to continue the regroup END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 width, back of a length, a late-cut from BATTER to third man END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 crunched drive on the full length, back past the bowler and a single to mid-off END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 crashing cut, bravely intercepted at point. That was four all the way too... END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 streaky pull, and lucky to get away with it! Plops short of deep backward square. No need to get panicky here for the new boy... END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 short, into the hips, flashed behind square, and the lack of timing gives BATTER thoughts of a second as fine leg races in END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 hits the splice this time, but safely through third man. Keeps the strike again and it's all Yorkshire so far in the Alliance of the Roses END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 width, slashed, hard through third man. A gimme to the gully in a Test match, but perfectly safe today. In the air for a while as third man watches the spin well off the grass to field END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 scampered single, off the back foot, good follow-up to the boundary, keeping the strike and the score ticking END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pressed to mid-on for an urgent single. BATTER is off the mark at the fifth time of asking END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 leg-sided, chipped off the pads behind square END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 flashed down to third via the outside edge. Uncertainty over the running, and bizarrely, they've taken the single END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 yorker, dug out to long-on. They consider the second, then decide against END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 dipping slower-ball yorker, dug out by BATTER towards third man, but there's an appeal for lbw. Did it hit the boot first and then the bat? Morgan doesn't review. Yeah, clearly hit the bat first on replay. And didn't actually pitch, so more like a dipping slower-ball full-bunger! END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 clipped into the leg side, throw comes in from Root at short midwicket. Would have been tight with a direct hit, but it's just wide END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 vicious yorker, dug out well into the covers and they take a quick single to Morgan, who misfields. 93mph/149kph END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 outside edge, down to third END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tight line into the legs, stabbed down off the hip, 89mph that time. END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 poked off the hips to the leg side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 nudged into the gap, and a comfortable single! A thing of beauty END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 utter chaos all round! It culminates in a direct-hit for the run-out appeal, but only after Bairstow had fumbled a clear-cut opportunity with both batters at the same end! He makes it home by a whisker! Fernando ran three full runs to his team-mate's one END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 another high-elbowed jab out to cover, well picked up on the run by Morgan, and the shy is close too END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pushed from a full length into the covers, to the off-side sweeper. 88mph first up END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tucked to the on-side, had Moeen gathered cleanly that would have been tight!

Good measured batting from Sri Lanka END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 flat pull, doesn't get up much from back of a length, deep backward square tidies up END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 runs the single down to third man with a hop back onto the stumps END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in short, BATTER does well to keep his pull down, out to deep midwicket END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pressed to deep cover, another single END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tapped into the covers, and this time it is BATTER's fifty ... excellent effort in his promotion END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 flicked off the legs for another single, as a dog trots onto the outfield END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 flicked off the legs for another single. The partnership continues to grow END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tucked off the hips to midwicket END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 whipped to the on-side, and another single to the cause END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 worked off the legs to the on side, another single to keep things ticking END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 swished out to the leg side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tapped to the leg side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 stops in the pitch on middle and leg, poked in the air back past BOWLER in his followthrough END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 gliding into a back-cut, using the width outside off to pick off the single to deep point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 opens the face on the back foot, pressed to deep point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 down on one knee, slog-swept to deep midwicket END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back over the wicket, targetting the left-hander's stumps, nudged to the leg side as he pushes the ball a touch too straight END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 worked with the angle off the hips once again END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 nibbled to the on-side, another single to the cause END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 very full length, swept to deep midwicket END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, poked to deep point END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 nudged off the pads, out to square leg, up comes the 100 END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 big stride, punched into the covers for the single END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pressed to the on-side to complete a very useful over. 13 runs coming to dent BOWLER's figures END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 onto the pads, tucked to the leg side, another fifty for the skipper/opener/keeper/anchor/impetus/everyman END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 hops into line, worked to the on-side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 round the wicket, just back of a length, poked out to point off the back foot END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 tight line, full length, flicked to the on-side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 flogged across the line to deep square leg, another single to keep Sri Lanka ticking.

I think so. Given as runs, which suggests so. Googly, which BATTER didn't pick, and it spun away from the bat as he groped forwards at it. Clear edge on replay, but KJP snatched at it, the ball hit him on the tips of the gloves and spilled away for a quick single towards the gully region END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 googly, pressed to long-on END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 banged in short, doesn't really get up, and BATTER swivel-pulls out to deep square END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 back of a length, steered down to deep third to retain the strike END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 pulls the short ball away, out to deep square leg END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 extra bounce, and BATTER punches off the back foot down to deep third END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 length ball, tucked off the hip through square leg END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 skips down the pitch but Binura follows him, cramping him for room as he works a length ball away into the off side END1 END2 END3 START1 START2 START3 dabbed down to backward point, where Avishka fields on the bounce.

BOWLER dug it in, back of a length and up towards his right shoulder. BATTER flapped at the pull, miscuing it down to long leg, and Binura couldn't get there on the bounce, diving forward.
