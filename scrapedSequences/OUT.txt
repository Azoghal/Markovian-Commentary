START0 START1 START2 START3 chopped on ! BOWLER makes the breakthrough . Too little , too late ? Length ball , angling across BATTER , who was hanging back in his crease after those short balls . He threw his hands at it , looking to flay it away through cover , but could only inside-edge onto the base of the stumps . The 91-run stand is broken , but England are nearly home and hosed END START0 START1 START2 START3 flashing drive to backward point ! That was richly earned in that over ! Pace and most importantly bounce , as BATTER threw his hands at the sight of width , and could n't keep his shot down . FIELDER tumbles to gather , and now we 've got a game ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 huge appeal ! Vast appeal ! Surely a noise ! Yes , gone ! That 's brilliant from BOWLER , tight line , back of a length , fizzing through BATTER 's midriff and nicking the edge as it does so . Pace , line , lift , nick ! He had to beg for the finger , so to speak , but umpire Robinson pondered for a while and eventually agreed ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 chopped onto the stumps ! Back of a length , not quite as much width as BATTER had bargained for , but he climbs into it all the same . A fractional misjudgement , and an under-edge into the sticks ! It 's been a blazing start , but Sri Lanka have clawed it back with two in two overs END START0 START1 START2 START3 a rushed hoick , and BATTER 's flustered innings ends BATTER 's fluent scoring somehow gets his team-mate 's adrenaline flowing instead , and a muffed attempt to claw a pull off a good length ends up in mid-on 's hands END START0 START1 START2 START3 comedy running once again , and both batters are at the keeper 's end . Throw comes in to BOWLER at the bowler 's end , and he does the rest . Someone find the Benny Hill music . Length ball from BOWLER , steered to FIELDER at point . BATTER had no interest in the single but by the time he 'd looked up , BATTER was stood next to him . FIELDER kept his composure and BOWLER knocked the bails off . BATTER sacrifices himself . Mickey Arthur has his head in his hands ... again ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 skewed straight to short midwicket ! Dug in , back of a length , and BATTER gets himself into a right pickle trying to work to leg . It loops up off the bat , straight to FIELDER in close , and Sri Lanka lose their eighth . From 145 for 3 , Sri Lanka have lost 5 for 15 . END START0 START1 START2 START3 huge heave across the line , and FIELDER pockets the pull ! It 's a long old boundary , and the man is stationed right back on the rope . BATTER 's valiant effort is over , and now England will be sensing a quick kill END START0 START1 START2 START3 crashed on the pad ... a huge pause for thought and Robinson puts up the finger ! BATTER reviews ... there 's no bat as the ball tweaks into a planted front pad , and it 's clipping leg ! Unlucky , had it been not out on the field it would have stayed not out . But England are deep into their day 's work now END START0 START1 START2 START3 sharp take at a solitary slip ! That 's brilliant from FIELDER , but also from BOWLER , pushing it across the left-hander , perfect seam position punishing the hard-handed punch , and the 150-cap man springs into action , diving to his left to snaffle BOWLER ' fourth of the innings ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 the short ball does it again for BOWLER ! BATTER takes it on , but the boundary is huge and he ca n't get hold of it , or keep it down . FIELDER sprints in from deep midwicket and scoops up another fine outfield catch , he took a similar one in the T20Is , and there ends a valiant innings ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 flaps at the pull , and FIELDER hares in off the fine-leg boundary to take an excellent catch ! Nine wickets between England 's left-arm opening bowlers . Back of a length , BATTER shaped to pull , and FIELDER ran in , dived forward , and scooped it up just before it bounced END START0 START1 START2 START3 tight to the stumps , gets a tickle on the pull , and FIELDER has five ! Celebrates with arms outstretched , and throwing his head back , almost relieved as much as anything else . Just a little flick on the pull , and FIELDER took a straightforward catch . Holds up the ball to the crowd , acknowledging the applause . Maiden ODI five-for on his home ground - and maiden international five-for , in fact ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 huge appeal from FIELDER for the stumping ! He 's convinced he 's got it . Big legbreak from BOWLER , a wafty drive , and almost a last-minute decision to whack off the bails as FIELDER 's toe strayed . There certainly does n't seem to be much behind the line . A stud at best . And yep , the umpire is happy that the line belongs to the keeper ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 huge appeal from BATTER for the stumping ! He 's convinced he 's got it .
