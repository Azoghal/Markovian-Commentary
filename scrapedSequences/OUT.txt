START0 START1 START2 chopped on! BOWLER makes the breakthrough. Too little, too late? Length ball, angling across Moeen, who was hanging back in his crease after those short balls. He threw his hands at it, looking to flay it away through cover, but could only inside-edge onto the base of the stumps. The 91-run stand is broken, but England are nearly home and hosed END START0 START1 START2 flashing drive to backward point! That was richly earned in that over! Pace and most importantly bounce, as BATTER threw his hands at the sight of width, and couldn't keep his shot down. Hasaranga tumbles to gather, and now we've got a game! END START0 START1 START2 huge appeal! Vast appeal! Surely a noise! Yes, gone! That's brilliant from BOWLER, tight line, back of a length, fizzing through BATTER's midriff and nicking the edge as it does so. Pace, line, lift, nick! He had to beg for the finger, so to speak, but umpire Robinson pondered for a while and eventually agreed! END START0 START1 START2 chopped onto the stumps! Back of a length, not quite as much width as BATTER had bargained for, but he climbs into it all the same. A fractional misjudgement, and an under-edge into the sticks! It's been a blazing start, but Sri Lanka have clawed it back with two in two overs END START0 START1 START2 a rushed hoick, and BATTER's flustered innings ends Bairstow's fluent scoring somehow gets his team-mate's adrenaline flowing instead, and a muffed attempt to claw a pull off a good length ends up in mid-on's hands END START0 START1 START2 comedy running once again, and both batters are at the keeper's end. Throw comes in to Curran at the bowler's end, and he does the rest. Someone find the Benny Hill music. Length ball from Curran, steered to Billings at point. BATTER had no interest in the single but by the time he'd looked up, Karunaratne was stood next to him. Billings kept his composure and Curran knocked the bails off. BATTER sacrifices himself. Mickey Arthur has his head in his hands... again! END START0 START1 START2 skewed straight to short midwicket! Dug in, back of a length, and BATTER gets himself into a right pickle trying to work to leg. It loops up off the bat, straight to Moeen in close, and Sri Lanka lose their eighth. From 145 for 3, Sri Lanka have lost 5 for 15. END START0 START1 START2 huge heave across the line, and Billings pockets the pull! It's a long old boundary, and the man is stationed right back on the rope. BATTER's valiant effort is over, and now England will be sensing a quick kill END START0 START1 START2 crashed on the pad... a huge pause for thought and Robinson puts up the finger! BATTER reviews... there's no bat as the ball tweaks into a planted front pad, and it's clipping leg! Unlucky, had it been not out on the field it would have stayed not out. But England are deep into their day's work now END START0 START1 START2 sharp take at a solitary slip! That's brilliant from Root, but also from BOWLER, pushing it across the left-hander, perfect seam position punishing the hard-handed punch, and the 150-cap man springs into action, diving to his left to snaffle BOWLER fourth of the innings! END START0 START1 START2 the short ball does it again for BOWLER BATTER takes it on, but the boundary is huge and he can't get hold of it, or keep it down. Livingstone sprints in from deep midwicket and scoops up another fine outfield catch, he took a similar one in the T20Is, and there ends a valiant innings END START0 START1 START2 absolute beauty, not far short of unplayable. This is liquid BOWLER Perfect length, angling in from over the wicket, nipping away just a touch off the seam, and finding the outside edge as BATTER gets forward to defend. A thin outside edge, through to Bairstow, and England have a third! END START0 START1 START2 edged and gone! Duck for BATTER on debut. Not much of a shot, if truth be told. Back of a length, bit of bounce, and BATTER plays away from his body with minimal foot movement, looking to punch defensively towards cover-point. Thick outside edge, and Root gobbles up the chance at slip END START0 START1 START2 pulled straight to short midwicket! Bit of a long-hop, 80mph and back of a length, and BATTER pulls with a full extension of the arms, but can't get it over Moeen, who takes the simplest catch imaginable! A cunning ploy... END
