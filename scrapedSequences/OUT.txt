START0 START1 START2 back of a length, plinked to short midwicket! Slightly too close to Roy's right hip to take on the shot, and he tried to muscle it past Dhananjaya, who was in tight. Not great contact off the bat but still came at him quickly, and DdS threw himself to his right to take an excellent catch! BOWLER stands Afridi-style, with arms outstretched, and BATTER has to drag himself off! END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 stumps splattered, BATTER drags on! SL have their breakthrough, and it's the peroxide leggie with neon boots who does the trick. Pushed through his legspinner a bit quicker, I think, and BATTER swung hard with malice aforethought, only to crash a bottom edge into his off stump! END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 flaps at the pull, and Rashid hares in off the fine-leg boundary to take an excellent catch! Nine wickets between England's left-arm opening bowlers. Back of a length, BATTER shaped to pull, and Rashid ran in, dived forward, and scooped it up just before it bounced END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 tight to the stumps, gets a tickle on the pull, and Curran has five! Celebrates with arms outstretched, and throwing his head back, almost relieved as much as anything else. Just a little flick on the pull, and Bairstow took a straightforward catch. Holds up the ball to the crowd, acknowledging the applause. Maiden ODI five-for on his home ground - and maiden international five-for, in fact END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 backs away, cutting straight to Sam Curran on the rope! BATTER was a shot away from his half-century and sat deep in the crease, flaying the short ball away into the off side, but could only pick out Curran on the boundary at cover-point. BOWLER has his third END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 holes out to deep square this time! Another wicket off a short ball and DdS falls nine short of a maiden ODI ton. Dug into the pitch by BOWLER, and BATTER took on the pull shot, but his timing was a long way off. Spooned up via the top edge, and Root shuffled to his right to settle underneath it. BOWLER gets his second, and the glue holding Sri Lanka together has been dissolved END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 takes on the bumper... but this time holes out! Picks out deep square leg, and that's the recovery stand snuffed out, a fourth for Big Sam. Wanted to hit in front of square, as he did in the previous over, but can only stand and grimace as it lands in the safe hands of BIllings. Don't look back, BATTER END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 goodness me. Pulled straight to the sub fielder, and SL are in disarray. The first time that BOWLER has dropped short, and BATTER takes on the pull. Horrible connection, with a 'plink' off the bat, and Garton, at short midwicket, takes the simplest of catches END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 cleans him up with a booming inswinger! Sam Curran is on fire! Sri Lanka in disarray against the moving ball. Full length from over the wicket, moving in sharply. Not much of a shot from BATTER, who is beaten on the inside edge and looks round to see his stumps rearranged, with middle pegged back. Curran leaps in celebration, and England have three early ones! END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 full and straight, and pinned lbw! Stinking start for Sri Lanka. Reviewed, but this looked very out to the naked eye. Swinging into the pads from a full length, as Avishka looked to clip out towards square leg. No bat, confirms Ultra-Edge. Only needs to clip leg stump... and is smashing it halfway up. Another review lost, and another Sam Curran wicket in his first over. END0 END1 END2 START0 START1 START2 big shout for lbw, and this one is given too! Bailey had a think, then put the finger up. BATTER reviews. No real movement off the seam, beating him on the inside edge. No foot movement from KJP as he looked to defend. Struck high, above the knee roll. No bat, impact in-line, and hitting the top of middle and leg. KJP is gone, second ball! END0 END1 END2
