START0 START1 legbreak, tickled away to short fine leg END START0 START1 worked around the pads to the on-side, BOWLER ploughing a tight furrow END START0 START1 fired into the pads on a flat line, nudged off the legs END START0 START1 strays onto the pad, clipped to square leg. Bairstow races out to do the fielding END START0 START1 strays onto the pads, clipped down to long leg END START0 START1 full and swinging onto the pads, flicked to square leg off the pad. Half-hearted appeal, always sliding down. No review ENDSTART0 START1 clipped away to square leg via the thigh pad for a leg bye ENDSTART0 START1 big nip off the seam, and thuds the pads! It might have done too much, but England review nonetheless Oof, he's deep in his crease as the ball zags back in, no inside-edge involved... yep, sliding over the top END START0 START1 big nip off the seam, and thuds the pads! It might have done too much, but England review nonetheless Oof, he's deep in his crease as the ball zags back in, no inside-edge involved... yep, sliding over the top ENDSTART0 START1 speared into the hips, tickled away behind square on the leg side END START0 START1 flatter on leg stump, goes for the sweep, it goes to short fine leg off his pad END START0 START1 this one swings in and ends up on the pads, tickles the pad to short fine leg END START0 START1 back of a length on the stumps, was looking to clear his front leg and pull but it hurries on to him - 148.5 kph - and he can't connect. Goes to short third man off his thigh pad END START0 START1 fullish on leg stump, goes off the pad to short fine leg END START0 START1 length on the pads, worked through backward square leg. Pinged off the pad actually, didn't get bat on it. ENDSTART0 START1 dug in back of a length and he was thinking it would rise up more, shaped to pull, copped a painful blow above the waist. They still take the leg-bye with the ball having rolled into the legside END START0 START1 massive appeal for lbw and BOWLER is annoyed that's not given. Tells Kohli to review it, who has a wry smile and does so. This certainly looked mighty close. uh oh, here's why the umpire didn't give it out: it's pitched outside leg. Moved after pitching to hit him on the pad, right in front, but that doesn't matter because the ball pitched outside leg. END START0 START1 into the pads, deflected behind square END START0 START1 flicked off the pads to the on-side. Literally off the pads ENDSTART0 START1 back of a length and slanting into the hips, diverted away behind square on the leg side END START0 START1 dug in short and on the hips, BOWLER gets away with that, with fine leg inside the circle. Flapped away square of that infielder ENDSTART0 START1 tickled away off the hip behind square. 87mph/141kph. Leg bye, so BATTER not yet off the mark in international cricket ENDSTART0 START1 back of a length, angling down leg. Can't put the flick away but gets a healthy amount of thigh pad on it, into the backward square leg region ENDSTART0 START1 round the wicket, attacking the pads, but that's missing a second set END START0 START1 fired into the pads, a wildly optimistic appeal for lbw, and while Afridi is pleading with the umpire, England scamper the leg bye END START0 START1 shaping into the legs, BATTER flaps to leg and scampers up the other end END
