START0 START1 tickled away off the hip, very fine, and away for a much-needed boundary from England's point of view. Flicked the thigh pad rather than the bat, according to Mr Robinson END START0 START1 tickled away down to fine leg via the pad, and Sam Curran does very well to get back and cut it off... or does he? They'll check this upstairs. Four! ENDSTART0 START1 goes wide of the crease and angles it a touch too far in, ends up slanting down leg, and BATTER misses the flick but gets ehough thigh pad on it to send it thudding into the fine leg boundary boards END
