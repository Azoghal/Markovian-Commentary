He did n't try to over-hit , just timed and placed it END START0 START1 START2 START3 too short again , he swivels and pulls through square leg this time . The previous ball had more power , this one had more timing END START0 START1 START2 START3 smack . Too short , and sat up , pulls through midwicket on the front foot with power END START0 START1 START2 START3 digs it in short and BATTER is quickly onto that , fetches the pull from outside off , gets on top of the ball , and puts it in the gap through midwicket END START0 START1 START2 START3 lovely shot . Too full on off , he transfers weight forward and on-drives to perfection , holds his shape and the pose as the ball races to the straight boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 pumped through wide long-off ! So close to another good delivery , but BATTER 's wristwork is outstanding , nailing it hard past the diving short cover END START0 START1 START2 START3 thrashed through the covers ! BATTER 's first boundary , as he climbs on top of a wide ball , and slaps hard down on the ball END START0 START1 START2 START3 low full-toss , and FIELDER nearly loses his knee-caps on a violent flog through the line ! Stand your ground man , it 's only pain ! What would Brian Close say ? END START0 START1 START2 START3 close to FIELDER at short fine leg , but another four ! BATTER rushes to fifty with a violent flick off his legs , trusting his timing to beat the close catcher , and nailing it behind square ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 too short from BOWLER , his variations are meat and drink to India right now , BATTER hops into line , and plinks his pull in front of the sweeper at fine leg END START0 START1 START2 START3 that 's a hit-me ball ! Short and wide , a variation maybe , but a pie in execution . Larruped through point with a massive wind-up END START0 START1 START2 START3 banged in too short , on the legs , rifled though midwicket ! BOWLER has been an intermittent threat but his inexperience has been picked off in between whiles . BATTER is beginning to find his range END START0 START1 START2 START3 round the wicket , banged in too short and BATTER climbs into the pull ! That was a meaty connection , like a juicy rib-bone , and it thumps the boundary sponge on the half-volley END START0 START1 START2 START3 given room outside off and he 's crashed that hard , FIELDER lets it through at cover . second time in two games he 's had that happen to him . Too short and he goes back to thrash it hard , FIELDER was wrong-footed as he was anticipating the ball coming to his right , had to stop and go left , but could n't get there . No protection behind him END START0 START1 START2 START3 googly outside off , but he cuts it well , pierces the gap between point and short third man to find the boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 regal from BATTER . Tossed up but too full outside off , he comes on the front foot , and unleashes a flowing cover drive that purrs all the way to the cover boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 Squeezed through the cordon ! Another streaky four for India , they are slim pickings at the moment , an excellent yorker from BOWLER , so nearly wriggling through , but toe-ended out of everyone 's reach END START0 START1 START2 START3 inside edge , and that 's very streaky ! Down the pitch to that one , as telegraphed with his first ball , India just itching to have a go , and FIELDER dives to his left but ca n't intercept a flying deflection END START0 START1 START2 START3 too full to open his account , and BATTER pings his first ball off the pads through midwicket ! Pressure already END START0 START1 START2 START3 banged in short and hoisted over midwicket again ! BOWLER is rather flailing through this over now , needs to finish well END START0 START1 START2 START3 short and wide , and clattered through point ! BOWLER 's losing his radar a touch in this over END START0 START1 START2 START3 plinked over deep midwicket ! A jiucy leg-stump half-volley to launch his fourth over , and BATTER is n't missing out on those ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 too straight from FIELDER , and that 's a freebie ! Swinging into the legs , and helped around the corner , clean through fine leg END START0 START1 START2 START3 spoke too soon ! A wide half-volley to finish the over , and BATTER gratefully spanks that through the covers . A loose one to end another fine over END START0 START1 START2 START3 high-elbowed punch !

Whistles through the covers , but not quite with the necessary elevation ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 crashed high over the covers !

END START0 START1 START2 START3 full toss , slapped through the covers ! Tremendous drilled drive , fast hands to capitalise on a rare bad ball ... it 's still on ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 that 's a pick-up and a half ! FIELDER spears in the leg-stump yorker , BATTER falls across his crease to force the angle in front of the leg-side sweeper . Top boshing ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 top-edged pull , and over fine leg ! BATTER loves to lamp it , and he does n't care how they come when he throws the bat ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 short , and nailed behind square ! Poor ball from FIELDER , banged in short but leg-sided , BATTER swivels well , hitting down on his stroke , clean past the sweeper ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 crunched through long-off ! England are self-evidently on the ropes , but they are still swinging into their punches .... BATTER drills the length very straight , and beats the sweeper END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length , and slapped lustily through wide long-on ! BATTER has n't given up either ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 flogged down the ground , and dropped by FIELDER again ! Another sitter , in front of the sightscreen , as BATTER fails to pick the slower ball , and hes spilled it into the ropes as well . Oops ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 down the leg-side , and that 's a fine pull , in every sense . Inside the line , deflected through fine leg , past the flat-footed keeper END START0 START1 START2 START3 wow , that 's a lovely strike ! On the back foot , pinged from a full length with lots of bottom hand , straight through the V at long-on ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 short , sits up , BATTER swings into a pull behind square ! Close to the boundary rider , but safe enough . A rare freebie ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 too short and wide , clattered in front of third man ! Every little helps . BOWLER 's leaky day continues , but he is a wicket-taker ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 BOWLER flings another short ball down leg with fine leg inside the circle .

Short and wide , he gets on top of the bounce , cracks it away to the right of point and left of deep third man . Make that three fours in four balls END START0 START1 START2 START3 overpitched and outside off , caressed through the line . BATTER leans into it and drives it straight of mid-off . Sweet as ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 BATTER is so very strong on the leg side . He shimmies out , takes a full ball from just outside off and whips it fiercely behind square , between the two men in the deep END START0 START1 START2 START3 chest-high short ball , angling into the body , BATTER follows the rousing on-drive with a rasping pull in front of square END START0 START1 START2 START3 much fuller and on the stumps , BATTER unfurls a delightful on-drive , finding the gap between midwicket and mid-on END START0 START1 START2 START3 dug in short and angling across him , BATTER leans back and cuts uppishly over backward point END START0 START1 START2 START3 attempted cutter , short and wide , this long-hop is duly carted away to the cover fence , beating the sweeper 's slide END START0 START1 START2 START3 eased sweetly through the covers ! He missed out on a full toss in the last over , but this time BATTER 's drive fillets the gap to excellent effect END START0 START1 START2 START3 more width , clubbed through point ! That was close to the fielder , but it was also travelling , that habitually open face fizzes the ball to the rope ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 sweetly timed off the back foot ! That 's been BATTER 's go-to shot so far , but this time he adds power to the open-faced glide , in front of third man . The ball zips across the increasingly dewy outfield , which will you suspect play some part END START0 START1 START2 START3 BATTER 's best shot so far . Fuller length , and a crushing drive from BATTER , all about the weight transfer , through the shot , through the covers END START0 START1 START2 START3 pumped through long-off ! Power and timing again , looked like he was lining up the cut , but aimed a lot straighter on impact , and there 's no intercepting that ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 clattered past backward point ! The catcher was briefly in business , but he threw his hands hard at that one , wide of off stump , and cuffed it to the rope !

Nothing wrong with that ball , full and angling back into the stumps , but BATTER pounds through his drive , hitting up into the ball , high over the on-side ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 two slips in place , but that 's too wide to take the edge ! A half-tracker outside off , and BATTER needs only to get a toe-end on his cut to rush that through the infield to the cover boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 curling into the pads , and clipped with sublime timing through square leg ! Outstanding from BATTER , timing over power in each instance , and filleting the gaps in the Powerplay END START0 START1 START2 START3 inswinger , belted back down the ground ! Well now , that 's set the tone ! Clubbed with a closing bat face through long-off END START0 START1 START2 START3 hard-handed stab , and that 's nailed through the covers ! That looked oddly tentative , not sure which way the ball was swinging , but watched it hard , and utterly pinged it ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 another slower ball , 115ks , on the pads , but the length is too full with mid-on and mid-off up . Whipped away stylishly to the right of mid-on for four END START0 START1 START2 START3 overpitched and outside off , drilled away past extra-cover , beating sweeper to his right END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length and attached with width , possibly a cutter from BOWLER . Yes , offcutter , BATTER sashes it away to the left of short third man for four END START0 START1 START2 START3 scythed away to the third-man fence . BATTER allows the short ball to come to him outside off , leans back , and chops it away between short third man and point END START0 START1 START2 START3 slower , shorter and banged down the leg side from left-arm around with fine leg inside the circle .

Too short and wide , and BATTER 's hands are so quick through the ball , hitting down on the stroke END START0 START1 START2 START3 clobbered through point ! Not timed as well as some , but placed well wide of the sweeper , and that 's another four to the score END START0 START1 START2 START3 pounded with violence through the covers !

Super scooper , high over the shoulder to disrupt a perfectly decent delivery END START0 START1 START2 START3 flicked contemptuously off the legs ! Who needs footwork when you have eyes like a hawk and wrists of steel ! Pinged high over midwicket , there 's a man lurking out there , but he ca n't get close !

This time he reaches it , gets on top of it , and flays it away to the right of deep third man END START0 START1 START2 START3 on a length , kicks up and moves away outside off , BATTER opens the bat-face and glides it away fine of deep third man END START0 START1 START2 START3 hip-high short ball outside off , 133ks , BATTER lines it up and swats it away with the angle to the right of FIELDER sweeping the leg-side boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 shortish and outside off , helped down to deep third man END START0 START1 START2 START3 Fifty up for India in 8 overs .

On a length and outside off , punchily driven between mid-off and short cover with a high elbow END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length and sliding into the hips , duly tucked away to the left of deep square leg for four END START0 START1 START2 START3 BATTER goes over the top again . On a length and outside off , BATTER camps back and ends up chipping it over short cover END START0 START1 START2 START3 short , wide , scythed away along the ground this time . BATTER jumps , gets on top of it , and puts it away in the off-side gap END START0 START1 START2 START3 short , wide , surely wider than a set of stumps outside off . BATTER reaches out for the ball , scythes it past the outstretched left hand of the man leaping at cover-point END START0 START1 START2 START3 back-to-back fours for BATTER . Even fuller and ends up straying on the pads , BATTER brings his wrists into play and flicks it away to the midwicket fence END START0 START1 START2 START3 BATTER hits over the top , pumping this full ball over mid-off . This is not a half-volley , BATTER stretches out , frees his arms , and collects four END START0 START1 START2 START3 full inswinger from BOWLER , but he ends up shoving it down the leg side , BATTER tickles it away so very fine for four END START0 START1 START2 START3 shot , BATTER !

Just a punch , really END START0 START1 START2 START3 banged in short , and BATTER latches onto the pull , nailing it through midwicket . 79mph from BOWLER , and it sits up so nicely for BATTER , who swivels and drags it from outside off , through the leg side END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length at 80mph/128kph , and BATTER nails the pull !

Driven confidently to the right of extra-cover END START0 START1 START2 START3 edged , and just out of FIELDER 's reach !

And BATTER too has his fifty ! The makeshift XI are flying once more !

Outstanding , and it brings up the 100 too END START0 START1 START2 START3 short , top-edged pull , clean through fine leg ! It 's a shot a minute now ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 short , pulled , short of the fielder , four ! Cripes , it 's all happening , BATTER climbs into the pull , does n't connect perfectly but deep midwicket ca n't decide whether to fling himself for the catch or stop the boundary , and manages neither ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 too short and wide again ! This are freebies to a well-set BATTER . Thrashed on the cut through backward point END START0 START1 START2 START3 width again !

Bad ball , needed to get out of that over without a boundary , but there was too much width too , and freedom for BATTER 's levers END START0 START1 START2 START3 outstanding timing ! Expertly shovelled through the leg side , right under the eyes on impact and pinging through midwicket END START0 START1 START2 START3 Two in two ! This one was flashier , but still fairly risk free . Backward point thought he was in with a chance , but BATTER had enough air on that to not worry much about Imam END START0 START1 START2 START3 misses his line by a bit , and BATTER latches onto it and cuts it fine of backward point .

England just keep coming at you END START0 START1 START2 START3 classy stroke from BATTER . Opens the bat face ever so slightly to beat point while keeping it away from third man in the deep . Threaded the needle , and picked up four END START0 START1 START2 START3 would you believe it , BATTER has been dropped again ! What on earth are they doing ? He sent it down to long-on , where , instead of FIELDER getting in position , tried to go after it one-handed . It spills out , because of course it did , and it goes for four END START0 START1 START2 START3 beats mid-off this time . Makes a bit of room this time and carves it past a diving mid-off . Once he was done for , that was four all the way END START0 START1 START2 START3 oh dear , FIELDER drops BATTER , and it really is a sitter . Landed on leg stump , with BATTER helping it straight down fine leg 's throat , where FIELDER spills it END START0 START1 START2 START3 full length , and drilled hard through long-off ! BATTER takes the BATTER route , big stride , tight lines , clean full face END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length , and butchered through midwicket ! BATTER trusts the bounce alright ! Back in his crease , hauled from outside off , timing ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 timing all the way ! Too wide again , BATTER is up on those toes again , caressed past backward point END START0 START1 START2 START3 cracked down on the cut , and pounded through backward point ! BATTER seemed to be shaping to pull for a moment , but either way he was up on his toes and well placed to slam another boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length , and BATTER seizes the change of length . A couple of steps to the pitch , and whipped around the front leg through midwicket END START0 START1 START2 START3 tremendous pick-up ! BATTER is deep in his crease to combat the tight line , and swings into his pull the moment BOWLER loses his length , one bounce into the rope at backward square END START0 START1 START2 START3 gets on top of his cut this time ! Enough width to flow into his stroke , hitting down and through third man , and that 's a swift outfield too END START0 START1 START2 START3 too short , and plinked off the legs through deep midwicket ! No unnecessary power , just placement across the line , as it rolls into the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 whipped off the legs , and superb timing once more ! Clean through backward square END START0 START1 START2 START3 drilled hard down the ground ! Emphatic straight drive from BATTER , using his height to stride to the pitch with perfect angles END START0 START1 START2 START3 banged in short , and swung off the hip through backward square ! Poor ball , too leg-sided for the field that Pakistan have set , and no-one can cut it off ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 outside off , slashed through third man ! One bounce and into the boundary hoardings ! Pakistan are rattled ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 driven again , fractionally undone by the nip off the seam as he checks his stroke ... but FIELDER 's shy deflects off the stumps , all the way to the long-off rope ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 In the slot and this one races to the rope ! Those levers are in good order , big stride to the pitch , firm back from a high backlift , too straight through long-off to be stopped END START0 START1 START2 START3 thrashed through point ! Imam leaps to his right but ca n't get close . Kitchen sink through that one ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 powerfully flogged through the covers ! It 's a stiff ask , but BATTER is up for it ! Freeing the bottom hand this time , to climb into the length outside up and slash it to the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 exceptional timing ! Full again from BOWLER , the swing is out there somewhere , but BATTER places a broad bat through the line , very straight through long-on , and eludes a futile chase END START0 START1 START2 START3 panned off a good length , over mid-on ! BATTER 's seen enough ! Off-stump line , shape into the arc , BATTER peppers the long-on boundary ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 does n't miss out this time ! Very full length , looking for the inswing , finding only the slot , nicely opened face to drive through point END START0 START1 START2 START3 starts off with a slog past midwicket that beats the fielder . He 's been off strike for a while but does n't seem to have lost much of his touch END START0 START1 START2 START3 this one 's similar to the ball that BATTER managed to streak away for four . It takes a top edge and sails over the keeper 's head . These runs will hurt England , it only adds to the pressure END START0 START1 START2 START3 flashes at the first ball , and gets a top edge over FIELDER . Ca n't put a fielder there , and BATTER picks up his first boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 this time he lay in wait for that short delivery , and hooked it past square leg for four END START0 START1 START2 START3 streaky , but he starts off with a four . Thick outside edge and with the pace the ball had on it , it scuttled past the keeper END START0 START1 START2 START3 extends that by four , slapping BOWLER in front of midwicket . Absolute demolition job this from BATTER , does n't seem like there 's a place to bowl to him right now . Just little England can do right now END START0 START1 START2 START3 BATTER with his inconspicuous elegance plays another lovely drive back past the bowler that beats mid-off . Picks up four more END START0 START1 START2 START3 much too far down legside , and BATTER comfortably sweeps this past short fine and pick up a comfortable four END START0 START1 START2 START3 sat up for BATTER , and he is dialled in . It was short of a length , and the bottom of BATTER 's bat dispatched it to the midwicket boundary with fair disdain END START0 START1 START2 START3 races away wide of long-off , concludes another brilliant over for Pakistan . It was a touch short and wide , poor delivery , really , and he had time to pick his spot END START0 START1 START2 START3 helped fine on the legside , got a bit of an edge , but the pace took it to the rope , and takes BATTER to a half-century . He 's played second fiddle but that does n't tell the tale of his innings END START0 START1 START2 START3 in the slot , and away for four . Poor bowling from BOWLER because there was no fielder around the wide-long-on region . Rolled his fingers over it and allowed BATTER to get into position and clobber him over that very region END START0 START1 START2 START3 punched off the backfoot to the cow corner boundary . Moved across very early and while he did n't get all of it , the placement is good enough to take it to the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 gets there with the cut shot , and BATTER lets off some steam now he 's got to his 14th ODI hundred Pakistan have been under pressure , and he 's been under pressure , but the Prince of Pakistan cricket was n't to be kept down for long END START0 START1 START2 START3 this time he finds the gap with the pull in front of square . Not enough pace to worry BATTER , and once it beat the man in the circle , deep midwicket did n't have a hope in hell END START0 START1 START2 START3 swiped away through the gap between fine leg and midwicket . Slower ball , I think , but it sat up at chest height for BATTER , and he picked out that gap masterfully END START0 START1 START2 START3 outstanding on-drive ! Here comes Pakistan 's A game , hurtling down the line like a freight train . A step to the pitch , bat like a pendulum , clean through long-on END START0 START1 START2 START3 too short , too slow , and BATTER seized that variation ! Crashing down hard on his pull , like a tennis smash in front of square END START0 START1 START2 START3 mid-off is up , so here goes BATTER ! A stride to the pitch and an inside-out clout over the off side END START0 START1 START2 START3 proper connection this time ! In position early , low into the sweep , and the resonant click of willow confirmed that was four all the way END START0 START1 START2 START3 crunched through the gap behind square ! Quick hands into the pull as BOWLER bangs it in once more . Excellent placement END START0 START1 START2 START3 flashed off the back foot , clean through the vacant slip ! A genuine nick , but he threw his hands at the lifter outside off , largely with impunity . Opportunistic END START0 START1 START2 START3 thrashed through the line ! In the air for a long while , but FIELDER at mid-off is flat-footed and has no chance of cutting that off END START0 START1 START2 START3 short , and slammed in front of square ! BATTER shows his class there , all the time in the world to set his weight , and wang his wrists through the pull END START0 START1 START2 START3 dispatched with a glorious wristy drive ! Clean through extra cover , bend of the knee , transfer of the weight , sonic-boomed to the rope ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 worked into the onside nicely and he gets another boundary Anything tailing down and he 's quick to take advantage END START0 START1 START2 START3 pulled away , and it beats the fine leg fielder Loose delivery to end with , short and at a nice height for Imam to swivel-pull square of the man in the deep END START0 START1 START2 START3 strays down leg side , and BATTER picks it up and works it through midwicket for a boundary . He finally gets off strike after 15 deliveries , and he has to ensure it 's not another 15 before he gets his next run END START0 START1 START2 START3 soon as I say that , that wretched run finally ends . Not convincingly , though . Thick outside edge that flies over the slips to third man . FIELDER failed to cut it off , and that 's a fifth boundary for Imam END START0 START1 START2 START3 this ones slightly short and slightly wide , allowing Imam to get into position and slash it past backward point . He appeared to get a hand on it , but could n't take the pace off it and prevent it going for four END START0 START1 START2 START3 too full , too straight , and for the third time this innings , Imam picks off the bowler with a clip to midwicket . He 's timing these well , and like the others , it races away to the boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 gets a nick as the ball runs down to third man . FIELDER drives to his right to parry the ball away . It 's a bit of a clumsy effort and his foot 's touching the line when he makes contact with the ball . BATTER has a boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 repeat of the first delivery this time . Much too straight from BOWLER , and the bat comes down and across and works him away to the midwicket boundary once more END START0 START1 START2 START3 nice , confident shot . Loose delivery outside leg stump , and he flicks it away to midwicket for Pakistan 's first boundary . They 're off and away ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 too short , he rocks back and hammers this to the vacant deep midwicket fence . Too much of a dragdown that time END START0 START1 START2 START3 imperious flick off the pads , ah , all the effort down the drain at deep midwicket . The fielder put in a dive but parried the ball past the ropes as he tried to pull it back in . END START0 START1 START2 START3 pulled imperiously ! How quickly did he pick the length up ? Astounding , Brilliant way to bring up your third ODI fifty END START0 START1 START2 START3 swept ferociously to the deep square leg fence . Runs bleeding now . END START0 START1 START2 START3 pulled ! Too short and sat up , he rocked back to hammer the pull a couple of bounces to the deep midwicket fence END START0 START1 START2 START3 width and he 's slapped that behind point . Shouts of catch , must tell you the bowler was being optimistic END START0 START1 START2 START3 whipped away with an air of disdain ! That was a half-volley on the pads and begging to be put away . BATTER merely lent direction . Desperate dive at fine leg but to no avail END START0 START1 START2 START3 this time it 's BATTER with the reverse sweep , just beats a leaping point fielder . END START0 START1 START2 START3 driven superbly into the gap , did n't try to hit it hard . Everything just so good about it . Half-forward and a gentle push with the timing top notch . So good to watch END START0 START1 START2 START3 smashed to the deep square fence ! BATTER on a roll now . Picked the length , rocked back and pulled imperiously . Dive from the man in the deep could n't help either END START0 START1 START2 START3 another reverse sweep , another four . This one hit even harder , between point and short third END START0 START1 START2 START3 cheeky little reverse sweep behind point ! Played it all along the ground against the turn END START0 START1 START2 START3 full in the channel , thrashed through point ! BATTER clouts his first ball to the rope to settle the nerves END START0 START1 START2 START3 tossed up , BATTER sweeps , nails this through backward square leg ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 short , a cutter , I think , mowed to the fence again ! Not short or quick enough to discomfit BATTER on this surface , and he rattles it away END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length , 83mph/134kph and slugged through midwicket on the pull ! Nice way for BATTER to get going END START0 START1 START2 START3 length ball , BATTER has a flash , edged wide of slip for four more ! Bit lucky but BATTER continues to brawl END START0 START1 START2 START3 full , BATTER sweeps , sends it fizzing to deep backward square ! Another crisp boundary for BATTER , who 's motoring nicely here ( cue : daft dismissal in two overs ' time ) END START0 START1 START2 START3 four more , third in the over ! Short ball , 84mph/135kph and BATTER cracks it dismissively between mid-on and midwicket END START0 START1 START2 START3 lovely timing , whipped away through midwicket ! BATTER just flicks the wrists , persuading an 85mph ball to run away to the rope , teasing the chasing fielder all the way END START0 START1 START2 START3 classy stuff from BATTER , drilled down the ground ! Weight coming forward , strokes through the line , whistles to the straight boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 on the pads , tickled to fine leg ! Beautifully done , late adjustment with the wrists , gets back-to-back boundaries END START0 START1 START2 START3 short and wide and carved wide of slip for four more ! Mostly top edge but it flew through the gap , went quickly and fine of third man END START0 START1 START2 START3 chipped back , wide of the bowler and the timing is so good that it races away . Turned the bat face trying ti work it to the leg side , this flew off a leading edge . Wow END START0 START1 START2 START3 again , sublime ! This is even better . Full , hint of width and BATTER shows he has great hands . Just opened the bat face gently and let his timing do the rest . No chance for the sweeper END START0 START1 START2 START3 square driven handsomely to the point boundary ! Too full , had the width and BATTER got forward and timed it beautifully . Raced away END START0 START1 START2 START3 top-edged , four ! Plain lucky is BATTER . On another day , would 've probably been caught by the keeper or square leg . Got big on him , but he got a big , fat top edge that sailed over END START0 START1 START2 START3 slogged over cow corner ! Clears the front leg and nails BOWLER 's googly out towards the unguarded midiwcket fence ! He 's a happier BATTER now END START0 START1 START2 START3 some turn and bounce outside off , BATTER throws the hands and slices a cut behind backward point ! Bounces wide of FIELDER and that 's going to run away for a welcome boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 pulled and pulled very well ! Sat up for him and he walloped it away all along the ground to beat deep square leg END START0 START1 START2 START3 scorcher ! That 's the shot of the morning to me . Overpitched and he put it away as it had to be . Crisp drive that bisected cover and mid-off . Will do his confidence a world of good END START0 START1 START2 START3 scorcher ! Sweetly timed to bisect cover and point . Not a half-volley but he went through without the fear of being consumed by late movement , sweeeeeeet END START0 START1 START2 START3 he 's given this a hokey pokey ! Left leg out of the way , belted down the ground over the bowler 's head . Woah , where did that come from ? END START0 START1 START2 START3 make that three in a row and this is the best of the lot !

Genuine edge as he 's squared up ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 finishes in style , another short ball smacks a pull shot to deep square leg and England win the series END START0 START1 START2 START3 he 's been unleashing fierce pulls but finding the man in the deep . This time he places it perfectly and collects a boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 gorgeous . Not exactly too full but he hits on the up anyway and great timing sees this ping into the long-off boundary seconds after it 's left the bat END START0 START1 START2 START3 peachy . Full on off and he punches this through midwicket with great timing . Was not going for a big hit but so well timed it races across the outfield END START0 START1 START2 START3 and that 's been leathered through cover . Goes right back and smacks it hard . Powerful shot END START0 START1 START2 START3 flayed over the in-field this time . England putting some pressure back on Ireland now . This was pitched up , BATTER did n't try to keep it down just went on the up and smacked it over cover . END START0 START1 START2 START3 stand and deliver . Width outside off and he smacks it through cover END START0 START1 START2 START3 in the air , but beats cover and threads the field thereafter to find the boundary . A mite early into the drive END START0 START1 START2 START3 BATTER 's gone but the boundaries have n't . Neat looking clip off his legs that purred through midwicket .

Remarkable shot , meeting the ball at the top of the bounce and chopping it in front of square END START0 START1 START2 START3 flashed high over the vacant cordon , and that is BATTER 's 3000 runs in ODI cricket , in his 72nd innings , matching FIELDER .

Clearing the front dog once more , and mullahing a pull across the line , timed so violently through midwicket ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 poor ball , but well played .

Another thumping dump of a shot , broad beam of willow arcing through the line , lifting the ball high over the ring and away to wide long-on END START0 START1 START2 START3 too short , and pounded gloriously through midwicket ! BATTER clears the front leg and lets his bat and eye do the rest ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 too full , too straight , pinged over deep midwicket ! BATTER is in one of his moods , you sense . And it 's a very good mood . Waiting for the ball but timing it so sweetly off the toes END START0 START1 START2 START3 that was all about the spawniness ! Threw the hands at more width , but BATTER got the absolutely perfect inside edge , nutmegging the keeper and fizzing to the rope . You ca n't set a field for that ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 flogged high and majestically over cover ! BATTER has now , officially , Had A Look . Width again , and sumptuous hands through the ball . All about the hands ...

Through midwicket this time END START0 START1 START2 START3 tossed up and pongo-ed through the line ! That 's the way to treat the leggie , committing to the front foot , a big wipe through the line , BOWLER leaps in vain to intercept END START0 START1 START2 START3 swept hard , swept well . Miss that and it 's plumb , but instead it whistles past backward square for a welcome boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 uses the pace beautifully to thrash the wide line through backward point , lovely wristwork END START0 START1 START2 START3 edged and so nearly the sixth !

END START0 START1 START2 START3 banged in short , but leg-sided , a well-placed pull , very fine behind square , rolling the wrists to send it rattling to the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 mown through the line !

A planted front foot , a wild wallop , more height than distance , but there 's no-one back there , right behind the bowler END START0 START1 START2 START3 clattered off the umpire 's head !

END START0 START1 START2 START3 flighted outside off and that 's nicely driven right in the gap through the covers with a nice forward lean to transfer his weight into it END START0 START1 START2 START3 ankling into the pads now , an error with the line and the batsman tucks it fine , and fine enough for four more . Eight from the over END START0 START1 START2 START3 pulls for a leading edge and that 's gone straight and high over the keeper for a one-bounce four ! Not a very convincing pull , the swing was half-hearted END START0 START1 START2 START3 hard hands again , rocks back in the crease for the shorter delivery and scythes that fiercely to send it past backward point for four END START0 START1 START2 START3 and more runs from BATTER .

It was too slow , too short and he hammered that with a pull between deep backward square and deep midwicket END START0 START1 START2 START3 he 'll take that , he swings half-heartedly , gets an inside edge and the runs away fine on leg for four END START0 START1 START2 START3 gets it almost in the block hole but BATTER clears his front foot and flicks that towards the cow corner , all along the ground , and the fielder from long-on puts in a dive but it goes for four ! Excellent placement END START0 START1 START2 START3 shouts of `` catch it '' again as BATTER charges , takes it on the full , and slams it over mid-on from outside leg to dispatch it in the wide gap END START0 START1 START2 START3 lofted straight down the ground , the field is in and that gets him four more , a one-bounce four .

Landed safely in the end , targeting an unguarded part of the field END START0 START1 START2 START3 unfurls the slog-sweep , into the gap in front of square ! Collared through midwicket , despite BOWLER 's optimistic shout of `` catch ! '' Hundred stand up between these two END START0 START1 START2 START3 smoked down the ground , clears the leaping FIELDER at long-on ! Did n't quite get hold of all of it , a lofted shot that was just straight of the man , who was never getting there as he ran around END START0 START1 START2 START3 slightly too close to cut , BATTER throws the plumbing anyway , skips away to the pickets at third man ! There was a man down there , BOWLER was briefly encouraged by the big top edge ... but landed a good few yards out of reach END START0 START1 START2 START3 short ball , slugged through midwicket , FIELDER ca n't quite reel it in ... Put in the dive but could only flick the ball along the rope for a boundary ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 comes down , not quite got hold of the lofted shot , but clears mid-off and bounces away ! Calculated shot , with the man up END START0 START1 START2 START3 testing line , BATTER stabs from the crease , edges past the keeper for four ! Not where he was aiming , but that wo n't show on the figures . BOWLER responds with a rueful grin END START0 START1 START2 START3 full toss , on the pads , shovelled over backward square for four ! Used the pace , just a flick of the wrists , behind the man on the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 smeared leg side , goes for the big heave-ho and spanks four through cow ! BATTER continues to fight fire with fire END START0 START1 START2 START3 pulled just wide of mid-on ! BOWLER bangs it in and BATTER cashes in with a powerful pull that was n't very far from mid-on .

Short on the leg side , he pivots on the back foot and smashes that over midwicket handsomely END START0 START1 START2 START3 too full and straight , that deflects off the stumps and still rockets to the long-off boundary ! That was driven with some force by END START0 START1 START2 START3 short and slapped , gets enough of it to run through the covers ... Beat the man in the ring and fetches four END START0 START1 START2 START3 slashed away over backward point !

END START0 START1 START2 START3 that 's a crisp cover drive ! Pitched up outside off and he did the necessary - big back lift and excellent flourish for a drive right from the middle of the bat as he leaned forward END START0 START1 START2 START3 edged over the slips ! Not the most confident way to get off the mark , it was short and wide and swinging away , BATTER threw his hands at it and got an edge thick enough to fly over the slips ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length on off , and pulled ! In the gap between deep midwicket and deep backward square leg END START0 START1 START2 START3 oh dear , game on is it ? Full and very wide , but he runs across the stumps and paddle-ramps a shot to the vacant fine-leg region for four ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 picks the slower ball early , and hammers this good length ball cross-batted to deep midwicket END START0 START1 START2 START3 there 's the hundred !

Full and punished END START0 START1 START2 START3 full , just outside off , and swept behind square , far from FIELDER at deep midwicket END START0 START1 START2 START3 slightly back of a length , and BATTER pulls awkwardly , bottom-edging in front of square . It races away to the sweeper 's left on the leg side boundary , and somehow gets away for four ! Did n't look like he 'd timed it at all , but enough power from the bottom hand to get to the fence END START0 START1 START2 START3 clears the front leg to give himself room , cutting a straight length ball for four behind square ! Premeditated from BATTER , who I think was looking to wipe this over midwicket again , but BOWLER hung it wide and he adapted brilliantly END START0 START1 START2 START3 short ball , gloved agonisingly out of FIELDER 's reach and away for four !

Heaved in front of square , nicely timed and away for four !

Fielder at deep point a mere formality END START0 START1 START2 START3 loopy , full , and he takes a giant stride to hammer a drive past the fielder cover and extra cover ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 reverse sweep first ball ! The audacity , you 'd think . Googly , full and smacked to the left-hander 's point region END START0 START1 START2 START3 good length , on middle , but too short . The googly goes further down leg , and BATTER flicks gently past the keeper 's left for a deft-touch boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 full on off , and this time he sweeps squarer than before , forcing FIELDER to give the ball a futile chase . A good end to the over , and BOWLER 's economy remains over 7 END START0 START1 START2 START3 up and over ! Eyes on the ball to see where it drops , and he takes a big stride to tonk it over the vacant cover region ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 short ball at the left shoulder , swatted away behind square for four ! 90mph/145kph bumper , but BATTER picks the length up early and guides it to the boundary with a pull END START0 START1 START2 START3 length outside off , genuine edge as he looks to punch through cover-point , beating third man to his left END START0 START1 START2 START3 hard length again , but too much width this time and BATTER gets it away through the ring .

Lovely controlled pull , 87mph/140kph , but BATTER picks up the length early and it races away behind square END START0 START1 START2 START3 slightly overpitched on the pads from wide on the crease . BATTER clips through straight midwicket towards the longest boundary on the ground , and it just about creeps over the toblerone thanks to some good timing END START0 START1 START2 START3 in the slot outside off , freebie from BOWLER as BATTER leans on the drive and flays it through wide mid-off for four ! ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length , BATTER gets it up over mid-off for four ! Slightly too short from FIELDER , banged into the pitch , and BATTER swung hard , cross-batted , to send it over the rope after a couple of bounces END START0 START1 START2 START3 brings out the slog-sweep to a full ball , flat on off stump , and finally gets his first boundary !

Too much width , and BATTER nails the compact drive to the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 too full , too much air given , and BATTER plonks his front foot down and gets underneath the ball to loft his on-drive powerfully , bounces a bit in front of the ropes END START0 START1 START2 START3 shot He 's not stuck on the back foot due to BOWLER 's threat and pace . Sees a short and wide one outside off and latches on , cuts it beautifully through point END START0 START1 START2 START3 sloppy work by FIELDER at deep square leg . Slips in the short one but not short enough and BATTER controls his pull shot through square . FIELDER makes a mess of it running to his right . END START0 START1 START2 START3 boom . BATTER may have been hopping against FIELDER but if he gets a full and wide one outside off he 's not going to hang back . Lashes this through cover with a strong bottom hand END START0 START1 START2 START3 gets on top of this and beats a diving point fielder to get a boundary . Width offered outside off , and room too with it being back of length . BATTER gets on top of it and cuts nicely END START0 START1 START2 START3 slower ball into the pitch , BATTER swings cross-batted and sends it back over BOWLER 's head for four ! He set himself early , anticipating the short ball , and picked the slower ball early , bludgeoning it dead-straight down the ground END START0 START1 START2 START3 slower ball on a length , BATTER pulls hard in front of square on the leg side , finding the gap between midwicket and deep backward square to pick up four ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 length outside off , BATTER slugs in front of square and picks up four more ! Looked like a slower ball , and BATTER shifted his weight forward , heaving through midwicket END START0 START1 START2 START3 full outside off , BATTER frees the arms and lofts over backward point for four to bring up the 50 partnership !

Room to extend the arms , and gets it comfortably over the man in tight END START0 START1 START2 START3 tossed up on leg stump , but that is a super shot by BATTER .

Flat bats it straight past the bowler , good timing and gets the boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 flayed through cover and that will break the shackles a bit . Fuller on off , comes on the front foot and slams it END START0 START1 START2 START3 stunning from BATTER . Seemed like an off-balance push but it goes straight past the bowler and into the boundary . He was making room , BOWLER bowled it full , BATTER seemed to gently punch it back , off the toe end of the bat . Timed well enough to go all the way END START0 START1 START2 START3 oh nicely done . BATTER 's shifted gears from 2 to 5 in the blink of an eye almost . Not that tossed up , but he gets to the pitch with a stride and uses wrists to drive over the in-field END START0 START1 START2 START3 reverse swept fine and he 'll get a boundary . Great execution . Tossed up on off and he committed to the shot early , and got the placement right END START0 START1 START2 START3 gorgeous .

Back of a length on off , stays still and punches through cover with beautiful timing . Finds the boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 just out of reach of FIELDER at deep square leg . Not sure BOWLER intended to bowl a short ball on leg stump given his field , but BATTER moves across and swivels to pull hard . FIELDER at deep square leg dives to his left , would have been a spectacular catch if he had got to it . But it eludes him END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length outside off , punched off the back foot and there 's a misfield at point which means it goes through and finds the boundary . FIELDER there I think , who was moving to his left and tumbled to stop it but made a hash of it END START0 START1 START2 START3 beautiful shot ! Bit of a half-volley from BOWLER , too much width and BATTER brings out an exquisite cover drive . It flies off the middle of that new bat and away for four ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 or maybe it was ! Length ball on fourth stump , BATTER heaves across the line and gets it just past backward square leg in the ring END START0 START1 START2 START3 shorter this time but too wide , and BATTER flays through point for four more !

Brilliant response , so nearly over the rope , just plugs inside ... BOWLER 's good work undone there ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 open-faced flash through third man ! Excellent batting , meeting the back-of-a-length delivery with an angled bat , where FIELDER ca n't cut it off ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 chipped the slower ball into the vacant region over midwicket , and that brings up his fifth ODI half-century . He needs to do a lot more to keep his side in this END START0 START1 START2 START3 opens the face and guides it down to third man . That 's bowled at over 85mph and it 's so fine third man has absolutely no chance END START0 START1 START2 START3 very similar delivery but this time BATTER decides to chop it away through the gap between backward point and short third to send it racing away for four END START0 START1 START2 START3 back at the cricket , though , we 've got BOWLER tonked away for four over extra cover . Made room and lofted it above the infield , and a diving FIELDER on the boundary ca n't cut it off END START0 START1 START2 START3 as I say that , he punishes a long hop by clattering this through the onside . Races away for four . It was a rare poor delivery from the offspinner END START0 START1 START2 START3 top edge off a short ball and that flies over the keeper 's head for four . You can see the anger radiating from BOWLER 's face at the moment END START0 START1 START2 START3 squeezes this one through the cover region , and it races away . Slightly overpitched and BATTER leans into it and finds the gap END START0 START1 START2 START3 round the wicket now , and that 's a fine stroke , down on one knee for the sweep , and hauling the wide-of-off line through square leg with powerful timing END START0 START1 START2 START3 pinged with intent through midwicket ! BOWLER sits up , and BATTER is waiting for him ! Timed sweetly as well . That 's the danger of speed on this surface END START0 START1 START2 START3 panned on the up , and straight through FIELDER at mid-off ! He barely had time to see that , let alone catch it ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 leaning onto the drive , and pumped through the covers ! Sweet timing , and even better placement END START0 START1 START2 START3 a whistling edge , flies over the heads of the cordon ! A genuine nicked drive , good pace . But first and second slip just looked and shrugged . Not reaching that ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 pounded on the up , and over long-off ! Loose so far from BOWLER , has n't found his length for this deck yet END START0 START1 START2 START3 compact cover drive . Fractionally over-pitched but that 's to the longer side of the ground so would have been a certain four on the standard measurements . As it is , they run the fourth anyway ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 tight line , but clipped off the hips with exceptional timing , towards the short leg-side boundary . Quickly on , quickly off ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 poor bowling . Full and wide , and that one was punished as it should have been . Carved through the gap past backward point and BATTER is one away from a priceless half-century END START0 START1 START2 START3 that 's a ridiculous shot . Went across and initially appeared like he 'd lap it to fine leg , but opens the face and squeezes it fine of short third instead . Brilliant thinking END START0 START1 START2 START3 gloriously picked up and BATTER lifts it over extra cover to send it trickling away for four . BOWLER going for the yorker again , and only just missed it . BATTER was good enough to capitalise END START0 START1 START2 START3 that ones very nicely placed . Made room and carved the short ball over the head of the man stationed at 45 . Intelligent batting END START0 START1 START2 START3 slapped back over the head of the bowler . It 's gun-barrel straight and it splits long-off and long-on in half as BATTER picks up his second boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 targets the short boundary once more . Lots of bottom hand into that clip to cow corner and England pick up a much-needed boundary . A first in nearly 5 overs END START0 START1 START2 START3 crunched through cover , and makes that look so easy . It races past the fielder in the deep , and what was n't a bad over from BOWLER is slightly tainted END START0 START1 START2 START3 crunches it back down the ground to finish the over with aplomb . Brilliant batting from BATTER , and England are moving through the gears now END START0 START1 START2 START3 this one 's overpitched and he 's smacked that through the empty cow corner region . BOWLER 's been put under pressure straightaway . Let 's see what the leggie has up his sleeve END START0 START1 START2 START3 dances down the wicket and slaps it through the wide mid-on region . Looked like FIELDER might have been in business but he ca n't quite get to it END START0 START1 START2 START3 reverse swept through the covers ! Panned in front of square . Hell of a stroke ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 rare width from BOWLER , and BATTER is in the mood to punish it ! Rolling the wrists on a thumping drive in front of extra cover END START0 START1 START2 START3 BATTER shuffles to the pitch , and finally takes on that alluring short boundary , waiting on the stroke and flicking calculatedly through the gap at midwicket . Solid END START0 START1 START2 START3 back over the wicket to BATTER , who chops wristily past backward point ! That 's firmly played and well placed , to keep the scoreboard ticking . The hundred is up END START0 START1 START2 START3 an 88mph short ball that BATTER tried to pull through midwicket . Did n't quite get it there but a thick inside edge squeezes it down fine and that brings up the half-century END START0 START1 START2 START3 squeezed through the two men behind square on the offside in the circle . A dive from short third gets a hand on it but ca n't prevent it racing down to the boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 same line but this time BATTER gets a faint tickle on to it and runs it down for another boundary . This is a little too easy for England right now END START0 START1 START2 START3 finishes poorly . Dragged down leg side and tickled down past short fine for a boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 flicked away through cover , and England continue to recover nicely from that disastrous first over . BATTER wrong with the delivery other than that it was perhaps a tad wide of off stump , but BATTER punished it . END START0 START1 START2 START3 short ball at 85mph . It seemed like BATTER had a touch too much time , and was almost set up for the hook shot . Nicely middled and FIELDER had little chance of cutting that off at fine leg . England ticking along smartly now END START0 START1 START2 START3 dances down the wicket and makes room for himself to carve the infield on the offside . Races to the cover boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 knew little about that . It was a short ball that BATTER anted no part of but as he swivelled trying to pull out of the shot , he gets a fortuitous edge that takes it sailing above the keeper END START0 START1 START2 START3 confidently chipped over midwicket . That was brilliant , picked up the line early and was onto it in an instant . It races away to the short boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 crunched past backward point . BATTER takes advantage of the shorter ball and cuts it away , and the bounce beats the man stationed in the circle END START0 START1 START2 START3 first real poor delivery . Half-volley , sat up to be put away , and he was onto it in a flash END START0 START1 START2 START3 opens his shoulders and gives himself room . The timing was perfect , as was the placement through cover-point .

END START0 START1 START2 START3 another smeared drive through the covers ! Clears the front foot , crashes the bat through the line , and bisecting the slenderest of gaps . Stunning power and placement END START0 START1 START2 START3 tossed up , crunched through the covers ! Up comes BATTER 's 15th ODI hundred , from 106 balls , on his full captaincy debut ! That 's one hell of a statement from the new man in charge ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 bashed off the back foot through midwicket ! It was n't even that short , but he just pivoted into the pull , to bring up 5000 ODI runs ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 launched on the up over cow corner again !

These runs are coming at a torrent right now ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 slap-pulled in front of square ! England are currently running out of answers . Another half-tracker , outside off , even FIELDER at midwicket ca n't get in the way of that one END START0 START1 START2 START3 that 's a dirty pie , and gobbled to the rope ! Rocking back , extending the arms through a lofted pull , as a half-tracker sits up to be munched END START0 START1 START2 START3 outside off , crunched through backward point ! Back of a length , width to free the arms , and out comes a glorious back-foot square drive END START0 START1 START2 START3 length ball in the channel , punched with a full face through extra cover and away for four !

That 's a good finish to the over , looped into the blockhole , and battered on the up through the gap ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 clubbed with venom over the covers !

END START0 START1 START2 START3 low full toss - so many full tosses ! - and BATTER this time flogs it with that spring-loaded bottom hand though long-on ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 wide line , crashed abusively over the covers , just out of the reach of the fielder ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 another full toss , sproinked over long-off with a full swish of the blade , not remotely timed , but does enough to clear FIELDER who , for some reason is still in from the rope , and who tumbles over the boundary hoarding for good measure END START0 START1 START2 START3 width again , full toss again , slapped through third man with a very deliberate edge . That 's a pricey over ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 wide full toss , full face of the bat and so much bottom hand it almost came round the back of the ball to dump it over long-off END START0 START1 START2 START3 battered fiercely on the up and over the covers ! Striding onto the front foot , swinging through the line . Power and placement END START0 START1 START2 START3 out it comes , BATTER 's trademark inside-out flip over fine leg ! He rehearsed that in the last over , gets good bat on it this time , not quite all the way , but easy to the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 pushed through and this is belted up and over cover , FIELDER should get round ... but he muffs it on the rope ! From the sublime to the ridiculous ( or at least the avoidable ) END START0 START1 START2 START3 tossed up his legbreak , outside off but BATTER takes a big stride and blaps a sweep through backward square leg ! He 's quickly found his groove END START0 START1 START2 START3 drops short again and BATTER pulls with a vengeance , pretty much through FIELDER at backward square leg for four more ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 dragged down and BATTER can batter it away through backward square leg ! A gim me four , that END START0 START1 START2 START3 floated up , BATTER sweeps and just gets something bat on it , as BOWLER was about to appeal for lbw - gets it away past short fine leg , too END START0 START1 START2 START3 pitched up and chipped lazily down the ground for four ! Just an extension of the arms from BATTER , cleared the man and it bounced away END START0 START1 START2 START3 short and on the hip , BATTER shovels it down to fine leg - poor line from BOWLER as there 's no cover there and it races away END START0 START1 START2 START3 full on off , overpitched and BATTER gets hold of this , smoked back past the bowler , that 'll be four to long-off END START0 START1 START2 START3 cracked through midwicket , BATTER is into his work already ! Short but it sits up nicely for a roundhouse jab to the fence , using the extra pace to his advantage END START0 START1 START2 START3 gets a touch straight , flicked away fine and that spoils a good over END START0 START1 START2 START3 overpitched , BATTER steps on to the front foot and caresses his first runs through cover , lovely bit of timing to get going END START0 START1 START2 START3 straight delivery , slightly short and BATTER pulls off middle stump , gets it away through backward square leg for four - first boundary BOWLER has conceded END START0 START1 START2 START3 pitched up , slower ball from BOWLER and BATTER times it neatly through backward point , wide of the man on the rope for four END START0 START1 START2 START3 clears the front dog , slashes through the line , and up and over extra cover ! BATTER is getting busy END START0 START1 START2 START3 slogged across the line , and through backward square !

BATTER gives himself room to the leg side , getting inside BOWLER 's offbreak and chopping firmly through the covers END START0 START1 START2 START3 a dirty slog through the line ! That 's old-school filth from BATTER , dumping the ball back over the bowler 's head with no thought about timing . Just pick the line and hit through it ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 BOWLER adjusts his line and pays the price ! Too much width outside off this time , and clobbered through point END START0 START1 START2 START3 too short , and tonked with intent through cow corner ! That 's more like it from BATTER , a stiff-forearmed slam across the line , reading the length early and loitering with intent on the back foot END START0 START1 START2 START3 on the pads , and BOWLER ruins a fine over with a wayward inswinger , helped off the legs through backward square ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 .... though to be fair , that is pretty poetic . One ball , one drive to long-off , and one utterly crushing victory ! All over in 40.2 overs ... the biggest defeat in terms of balls remaining in England 's history , and the series is shared 2-2 ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 smoked on the up over the covers ! Well , that might reignite the after-burners . BATTER retreating to leg to have a wipe , and some ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 over-pitched this time , and thumped uppishly through long-on . Not remotely timed , but there 's no-one to haul it back as it rolls into the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 fine leg has just moved to cover the off side , so BATTER suckers a clip off the toes instead ! This is nonsense ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 leans back again , making room for the ramp ! Two men back for the slog to leg , so BATTER gives himself room on the off-side , and guides it with an open face ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 a roundhouse whumping through square leg ! Opens his body to face the lifting ball chest-on , and splattered to the boundary ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 short again , pulled again , this time in the direction he was aiming ... Not out of the meat again , but it gets past midwicket and races away END START0 START1 START2 START3 dug in at 131kph/81mph and BATTER swings at it , toe-ended top edge but it clears the cordon !

First boundary for END START0 START1 START2 START3 floated up and pinged through the covers for four ! Beautfully done , power and placement as he threaded the gap END START0 START1 START2 START3 dug in short , BATTER collars it on the pulls this time - rammed through midwicket , rocketing off the bat for four more ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length , 138kph/86mph but there 's width this time and BATTER rides it , clatters the merry wossname out of a cut in front of square that races away - no cover out there , which is a sign of how well West Indies have been bowling END START0 START1 START2 START3 thrashed through the covers ! BATTER has been an excellent opportunist today , just a fraction too full for the line , so he stays leg-sided and threads through the covers again ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 cracked supremely through the covers ! That 's lovely from BATTER , threading the gap in the covers with a measured , controlled cover drive . END START0 START1 START2 START3 flashed in the air and through the covers ! That one sat up to be biffed , up on the toes and clean in front of point . In fact , that reached FIELDER on the full ... a dropped catch ! END START0 START1 START2 START3  END START0 START1 START2 START3  END START0 START1 START2 START3 driven with conviction through the covers ! Better intent from BATTER , stretching forward and hitting at the top of the bounce , well placed through the ring END START0 START1 START2 START3 much fuller , and that 's an elegant strike through long-on ! A full swing of the bat , clean through the line and beats the diving mid-on END START0 START1 START2 START3 too short , beaten for pace , but gloved up and over the keeper 's head ! Effective enough , and nearly carries all the way to the rope . Lots of carry on this deck today ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 more dramatic bounce on the hips , and BATTER leans inside , pops it out of the reach of the keeper , and FIELDER does his best Curtly-at-fine-leg impression , aiming a big boot at the ball , missing , and hurdling the advertising hoardings in his run-off ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 banged in and rattled to the fence ! Not a bad bouncer , 85mph and up around the nostrils but Imam watched it closely and battered the ball through square END START0 START1 START2 START3 too short , too wide , flogged through backward point . Whoops END START0 START1 START2 START3 firmly pumped down the ground Sweet timing , just a touch too full , nice straight lines , leaning his weight into the impact , and there 's no cutting that off END START0 START1 START2 START3 round the wicket , overpitched by BOWLER , 85mph outside off and drilled to the cover boundary with aplomb END START0 START1 START2 START3 short and wide , hittable stuff and FIELDER dispatches a crisp cut behind backward point !

Finally a shot in anger against BOWLER , beautifully played as he rolled the wrists over a cut - first boundary BOWLER has conceded END START0 START1 START2 START3 shot ! Too full and drifting leg side from BATTER , 86mph but that just assists it in flying to the boundary , neatly tickled off his toes by END START0 START1 START2 START3 banged in at 82mph and Imam takes it on , nonchalantly whacked through backward square on the pull ! Soundly struck for Pakistan 's first boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 banged in and rattled to the fence !

FIELDER was racing around but could n't get there as the ball bounced across the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 scooper dooper ! Inverts his stance once again , meeting the full length outside off with a solid flick of bat , up and over third man ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 clears the front leg , and launches an up-and-over drive , a couple of bounces into the rope ! Runs are flowing ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 leg stump full-toss ! A rare loose one from BOWLER , and BATTER nails his sweep on the full END START0 START1 START2 START3 that is supremely cheeky !

END START0 START1 START2 START3 short , pulled , through square leg ! England have persistently banged it in and been punished of late .

Not quite out of the screws , but good intent from the bespectacled opener END START0 START1 START2 START3 inswinging yorker , not a bad delivery really , but BATTER is set deep in his crease , it 's probably six inches short of optimum length , and clubbed on the up to the rope again ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 opens the face , third man is up , so he squirts it through the gap ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 up comes BATTER 's fifty !

Two steps down the wicket from BATTER , meeting the tight line with a round-house pull , bissects the field superbly END START0 START1 START2 START3 too short again , this is vacuous from BOWLER , ca n't find a length of any description , and BATTER pummels him through midwicket with a compact roll of the shoulders END START0 START1 START2 START3 short and flat , flogged through the leg side ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 darted outside off , BATTER reverses the hands like quicksilver and kisses the ball just wide of the keeper for four more END START0 START1 START2 START3 stays around the wicket , drifting across and into the slot for BATTER to ram a drive through the covers for four - that 's the first boundary BOWLER has conceded END START0 START1 START2 START3 short of a length , sits up for some punishment and BATTER swipes four past mid-on , out of the meat and it skedaddles away END START0 START1 START2 START3 overpitched , BATTER seizes on it , skelps a straight drive back pas the bowler for four !

END START0 START1 START2 START3 wide full-toss , that 's just a pie , and guzzled through backward point ! England are n't home yet , but jolly nearly ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 power-drilled through the covers ! On the up , aimed clean through the gap in the covers END START0 START1 START2 START3 outside off again , a flashy edge through third man ! The imperfect Test match edge to third slip ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 short , slower ball and BATTER is advancing again , clubbed back down the ground ! Wo n't quite fly all the way , but BATTER has the bit between his teeth END START0 START1 START2 START3 goes around the wicket , slides the ball in on the pads ... and is tickled nonchalantly for four to fine leg , BATTER quietly motoring at around a run a ball himself END START0 START1 START2 START3 overpitched on the stumps and this is just eased off the pads through midwicket for four more END START0 START1 START2 START3 full , 85mph , draws the outside edge ... but there 's no slip in !

END START0 START1 START2 START3 cheekily done by BATTER , ramped over the keeper for four ! Using the pace BOWLER generates and deflecting it up and away to the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 slung down , leg side and this just requires a cross-batted bash to help it down to fine leg ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 all around the clock , this time to fine leg ! BATTER hops across and ramps impudently over the infield ! No one down there END START0 START1 START2 START3 short at 85mph and BATTER rattles off another pull , seemingly just to deep backward square for one , only for FIELDER to collect the ball on the roll , then squirt it back out of his grasp for four ! You could n't do that again if you tried END START0 START1 START2 START3 dumped with disdain back over the bowler 's head ! Planting the foot , hitting through the line , trusting the bounce ... it 's a munch-fest . And BATTER takes the lead for the first time today ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 too full , too leg-sided , too easy to pick-pocket that one . Clean through midwicket once more ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 yawned behind square for yet another boundary , and BATTER has his fifty too !

Absolutely smoked through the covers , reaching the full length and wide line , munched at the top of the bounce , and the sweeper has no chance ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 belted down the ground ! In the air for a while , and a tantalising one for mid-on , but he was never able to move in time END START0 START1 START2 START3 short and pulled round the corner , a pause mid-stroke and a delicate paddle through fine leg END START0 START1 START2 START3 short , smoked through midwicket with a sonic boom of a pull ! A beautiful echo of willow and a futile dive from Imam END START0 START1 START2 START3 flipped behind square ! That 's the one BATTER has been waiting for , a touch back of a length , on the pads , BATTER walks inside the line to help himself END START0 START1 START2 START3 this time BATTER hops inside the leg-stump line , flicks off the hip and away to the rope !

A roll of the wrists on impact and whistled past square leg END START0 START1 START2 START3 impeccable ! There 's been a bit of scratchiness on show , but not on this occasion , overpitched outside off , and thumped imperiously through the covers !

END START0 START1 START2 START3 full and wide , BATTER makes a bit of room and swipes it between two men to the wide long-off boundary ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 pitched up , slower ball on the toes ... but BATTER picks it and belts four back down the ground ! Humpty Dumptied over the bowler 's head ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 short , wide and flogged over backward point ! BATTER carves it up and away behind square END START0 START1 START2 START3 length outside off , 82mph and Imam dances down , hacks a top edge over the head of backward point - that 's four more ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 full toss sliding on to the pads and Imam tucks in with a flick through backward square , BATTER 's slide on the boundary in vain END START0 START1 START2 START3 eurgh , a disgusting full toss wide of the stumps and Imam gives it the appropriate treatment , smeared over backward point and away ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 pitched up , 86mph but straying a touch leg side and he only has to glance it to the side of short fine leg and it 's four ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 short and swatted away , into the gap at deep midwicket !

Cleverly done , turned the ball into a half-volley END START0 START1 START2 START3 fullish in the channel and Imam throws the hands through a crashing drive , no one is cutting that off END START0 START1 START2 START3 short , leg-sided , pulled , beats third man to move to 99 END START0 START1 START2 START3 on the toes , clipped to backward square , too full and off-line , beats fine leg 's despairing slide . Pakistan are brawling END START0 START1 START2 START3 too short from BOWLER , rises to a nice pullable height , and clobbered in front of square , neatly bissecting the two sweepers END START0 START1 START2 START3 another full toss , outside off stump , and walloped over long-on ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 flicked off the toes , out through the leg side , that 's good connection and zips to the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 biffed through the line ! That 's Imam 's most forceful stroke of the day , he 's seeing it well now , down the pitch and attacking the length with a full-blooded drive END START0 START1 START2 START3 yomped through the line ! That was inelegant but effective , a not-remotely-to-the-pitch slap , hitting on the up and through long-on . They all count END START0 START1 START2 START3 cunning . Really late , late dab through third man , reading the outswing on a back of a length , and guided expertly past the keeper END START0 START1 START2 START3 short , wide , slashed , down past FIELDER , and away to the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 steps out and absolutely woofs a lofted drive over the covers ! BATTER is cruising here , windows down , music up END START0 START1 START2 START3 pitched up , BATTER takes a step out - stroked through the covers this time ! Threads the gap between the men on the ring and gets four more ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 round the wicket , 85mph and sliding into the pads , silky whip of the wrists from BATTER and it skips away ! Two men out but it bisects them for another boundary to END START0 START1 START2 START3 full and swinging a touch , 82mph and again thrashed through the off side with impunity ! No need to move the feet when your eye 's that good ... Four straight off the bat END START0 START1 START2 START3 full and in the slot , 84mph but BATTER likes this , opens his shoulders and absolutely Jon Ronsons that for four through the covers ! Boshty END START0 START1 START2 START3 spanked ! Short outside off , rasped through backward point at the top of the bounce !

END START0 START1 START2 START3 pitched up , tempts the drive again , Imam times this one to the rope at long-off ! Just a checked punch coming forward but it leaves FIELDER in the dirt trying to chase it down END START0 START1 START2 START3 shot ! Too full , Imam steps out and crunches a cover drive to the fence ! Fetch that END START0 START1 START2 START3 four more ! Though this one owed more to fielder error , FIELDER diving past the ball at square leg and then failing to chase it down ! He is absolutely steaming with himself END START0 START1 START2 START3 dug in short , 83mph but that 's not bothering BATTER , who strongarms a pull around the corner ! The crack of that off the bat ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 timed like a horologist back down the ground ! Just a touch too full from WIlley and BATTER just showed it the bat face , sending the ball scurrying to the straight fence END START0 START1 START2 START3 just a fraction overpitched , 81mph and Imam presses out to ping an on-drive past the dive of the man on the ring , trundles away for four END START0 START1 START2 START3 good length outside off , Imam fences away from his body ... and thick-edges wide of slip for four ! Pakistan 'll take 'em wherever they come ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 full , 85mph outside off , BATTER slashes a thick outside edge for four !

Breezy smash for four , brings up BATTER ' first half-century of the series END START0 START1 START2 START3 flicked off the pads through backward square , FIELDER is nutmegged for four ! Not so much a long boundary as a lounge , way too casual and the crowd let him know ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 another slower ball dug in , around the ribs , BATTER hammers it through midwicket , one bounce to the fence ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 low full toss and BATTER slices it through backward point for four ! Just used the pace and it rocketed away END START0 START1 START2 START3 bounces him , up around the eyes , but BATTER goes toe-to-toe ( so to speak ) , whumps a pull away through backward square - that gives fine leg no chance ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 guided through to third man , and this is lamentable from FIELDER ! He 's had a mare down there . Should have been easily cut off , but the poor bloke misfields , and allows the ball to trickle over the rope . END START0 START1 START2 START3 excellent comeback from BATTER ! Waited for the ball to come to him and strokes it away through point . Uses the pace of BOWLER , and helps himself to a pressure-easing boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 Short , but not quite as accurate this time . It takes only two deliveries for BATTER to feel confident enough to pick this one up early and pull away off the front foot to the legside boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 good pace again , but this is classy from BATTER . Anticipated the length , and gets a feather touch on it , running it to the third man boundary . END START0 START1 START2 START3 fuller , but dragged down to the legside , where BATTER tickles it away for a teasing chase . Poor FIELDER puts in a dive , but ca n't stop the ball hitting the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 short , slapped away for a boundary ! BATTER picks up the length absurdly early , and is waiting for it . A baseball swing clears mid-on and sends it to the boundary . END START0 START1 START2 START3 BATTER getting in on the action here . No aggression whatsoever , just a classy backfoot cut . Sends the ball racing to the point boundary ! England on the charge again END START0 START1 START2 START3 gets the short boundary on this occasion . Scythes it through the infield , and there 's no stopping it for long-on there END START0 START1 START2 START3 keeps low but BATTER adjusts smartly , thwacks it through the covers END START0 START1 START2 START3 short and wide , battered through point ! You ca n't bowl there . BOWLER needs a drink . And so do we all ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 that 's too wide , a non-spinning pie , half-way down the pitch , and spanked through point . An immediate apology END START0 START1 START2 START3 short , top-edged pull , sails away to the rope for another well-worked fifty END START0 START1 START2 START3 outside leg , too full , swept with venom ! A one-bounce four , inches inside the rope at backward square END START0 START1 START2 START3 banged in short , a top-edged pull through fine leg ! in the air for a while , but ends up dribbling over the rope as the fielder makes an utter horlicks of it END START0 START1 START2 START3 outside off , tight line , fenced into the covers off the back foot END START0 START1 START2 START3 swept with intent , behind square . So nearly the breakthrough , now six from two balls END START0 START1 START2 START3 outside off , a hint of swing , crunched through the covers , not a terrible ball from BOWLER , almost 90mph , but the width gave BATTER licence to free his arms END START0 START1 START2 START3 far too much width on a wide line ! Half-stopped - three-quarter-stopped really - in the covers , but that was hit with venom and still reaches the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 leans back for a spank over the covers ! Not timed at all , but bobbles away to the rope , he played the field , and won , with acres of space in the deep END START0 START1 START2 START3 saucepanned through long-off ! That 's more like it from BATTER , a big front foot and a wallop through the line . BATTER lifts his bat at the non-strikers ' end to allow the ball to whistle through END START0 START1 START2 START3 muscled on the up through the on-side , the bat twisted in his hand on impact , and skewed an attempted launch over cover into a scuff through midwicket END START0 START1 START2 START3 lucky lucky ! Swinging into a pull , the ball skidded through flatter than anticipated , and a bottom-edge skims over the bails and away past the keeper ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 on the back foot , crunched with silken intent through the covers ! Oh crumbs , he 's not wasting time with his timing ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 backs away , clubbed back fine of mid-off , not the cleanest connection as FIELDER gives chase ... FIELDER is also coming round from long-off but muffs his attempt to field and sends it on to the rope ! So Pakistan end with a boundary and England will need 341 to win END START0 START1 START2 START3 steps away , BOWLER misses his yorker , absolutely blootered through cover to the short boundary ! The sound of that off the bat told you it was four END START0 START1 START2 START3 short ball , this time BATTER gets it away , scooped up and over short third man for four ! Cannily done END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length at 88mph , BATTER makes room to baseball bat this thorugh the leg side , picks the gap between long-on and deep midwicket for four ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 placed , canny stuff from BATTER , knows the field and swipes a cut through point - does n't have to move as it bounds away for four ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 slower delivery but it 's short and wide , BATTER gives crashes a cut lock stock and barrel over the covers ! Nailed that one END START0 START1 START2 START3 full , 90mph and smeared through extra cover ! Pace on , pace off as the ball flies to the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 short and slashed away through backward point , into a gap and that 'll run away ! Excellent over for Pakistan END START0 START1 START2 START3 slower ball , short of a length , rammed through extra cover ! BATTER continues to pick up the pace END START0 START1 START2 START3 shortish outside off , 91mph and BATTER gets a thick outside edge , that 'll skip away for four ! Back-to-back boundaries , to BOWLER 's chagrin END START0 START1 START2 START3 full and straight , but essentially a leg-stump half-volley and he rams it through midwicket for four END START0 START1 START2 START3 on the pads , clipped fine , that 'll be four and a fine hundred for BATTER ! His ninth ODI ton from just 60 innings , off comes the helmet and he then bows to the ground . Time to launch , BATTER , old chum END START0 START1 START2 START3 short and carved over backward point , 83mph and helped away wide of third man with a flash for four ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 short , 90mph but he 's given BATTER a free swing , carved away through point , that 'll be his fifty ! Continues to find the boundary each time Pakistan need it END START0 START1 START2 START3 full length , gets holds of this and it whistles away with interest in front of cover , beats FIELDER 's despairing dive on the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 slower but well wide of off stump . BATTER leans on the ball and allows his weight to come through it . Timed beautifully and the ball races through to the off side boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 uppish ! BATTER heaved at that one , and did n't middle it . Dangerously close to FIELDER at short midwicket , who dives valiantly to his right . The ball 's just out of reach , and goes all the way END START0 START1 START2 START3 wide again , this has been an ordinary over from BOWLER . Almost a carbon copy of the first ball , BATTER has an easy put away to the cover boundary again . END START0 START1 START2 START3 this is a better shot ! Flighted from BOWLER , and BATTER had the time to smash this through extra cover , beating the boundary fielder END START0 START1 START2 START3 cleared over the mid off fielder . BATTER made some room for himself , and middles this one nicely ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 too short , picked early , a bottom-handed shovel through the gap at backward square ! A slower ball too , lots of time to pick his spot END START0 START1 START2 START3 makes room , uses his feet to capitalise on some rare width and dumped over the rope at long-off ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 sweetly nailed through the covers ! Lovely weight transfer , he 's really got the measure of this deck now ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 biffed firmly through backward point , too much width there END START0 START1 START2 START3 a smoke across the line ! Full again , BATTER 's right leg goes for a chat with the square leg umpire , and a wild hoick is battered past backward square ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 too short , a gossamer-light deflection off a scuffed pull and that 's ample to send it way wide of the keeper ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 hoisted off the pads , through square leg ! Lovely timing . BOWLER just beginning to get collared now . Or relatively collared ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 more sumptuous timing ! BATTER rather likes pace on the ball , it seems ! Opens the face , nails the back-foot drive , through the covers ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 this time he is ! Too wide again from BOWLER , but this time BATTER is ready for it , crunching a cut to the rope ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 makes an early move down , comes out as a full toss ... and BATTER slugs it over mid-on for four more ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 gives it some more tap , walloped over cover for four ! A further dent for BOWLER ' figures , as BATTER continues to enjoy his big day out END START0 START1 START2 START3 short ball , hooked into the air towards fine leg , FIELDER goes for it ... bounces just short and then skips for four ! He made a terrific flying effort , to be fair , but the chance was always out of reach as he ran around END START0 START1 START2 START3 slapped over mid-off , decent hit and it bounces away ! BOWLER will be steaming . here END START0 START1 START2 START3 boundary for BATTER , stepping outside leg and squeezing a full delivery past backward point . Look at him go ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 cheekily done by BATTER , reaches those Go-Go-Gadget arms out and tickles a top edge up and over the keeper for four ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 pitched up and slogged over mid-off , just clears the leaping FIELDER ! Pretty well struck by BATTER for his first boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 banged in short , BATTER sways and swats behind square , not entirely comfortably but it skips away to the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 short and wide , BATTER rocks back and belts a cut through point ! Poor ball to finish , but FIELDER has otherwise done his usual respectable ( by modern standards ) holding job with 10-0-63-0 END START0 START1 START2 START3 he 's latched onto that one and sent it firmly to the boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 leg-side line from FIELDER and he 's turned it square to the boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 a slower ball , he hits it on the half-volley and drives it down the ground END START0 START1 START2 START3 and again , two steps down the pitch , up and under it and it 's away with one bounce over the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 he 's got under that one and lifted it away for a one-bounce four END START0 START1 START2 START3 he 's gone for that one , outside off stump and he 's swept that one away smartly END START0 START1 START2 START3 that 's what he was after , a big step forward , down on one knee and turns it away to the fine leg boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 he picks that out and lofts it over mid-wicket nicely END START0 START1 START2 START3 he 's latched onto that one , driven it straight down the ground , FIELDER has come running across to cut off the boundary , he makes a very good effort but the ball slides under his sliding body and it 's gone into the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 read the googly , steps back a little and smacks it through mid-on for a boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length and a lovely touch from the batsman just sends it on its way to the boundary at third man END START0 START1 START2 START3 opens the face , clobbered through point ! Irrespective of everything , this is a tremendously pleasing innings to watch END START0 START1 START2 START3 faster , fuller , but angled into another cunning leg flick . Fine leg is up , so no retrieving that END START0 START1 START2 START3 sliding onto the legs , languidly flicked through backward square . BATTER walking inside the line in an instant and making the shot look simple END START0 START1 START2 START3 leaning back , belted with Ponting-esque barrel-loads of timing , clean through midwicket . This is already a sumptuous innings END START0 START1 START2 START3 gorgeous ! High-elbowed elegance , leaning onto the fuller length and caressing to the rope ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 leaning back and caressed through point ! Smoked like a kipper , at the top of the bounce ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 flogged off the back foot , clean through the covers ! BATTER is in the mood to make merry . Nothing like a lost cause for freeing up the strokeplay ... and who knows , much more of that , and it wo n't be so lost ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 too short , dumped through midwicket for a one-bounce four and BOWLER ' figures have been massacred . Knew he should have quit while he was ahead ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 opens the face to drill through the covers ! That 's sublime timing , head leaning into the ball and crunched along the deck . Lovely END START0 START1 START2 START3 outrageous , an ice cream scoop straight over his head ! Like tossing a pancake , but so hard you almost hit yourself in the face ! Bounces away for four more , much to FIELDER 's irritation END START0 START1 START2 START3 full outside off , BATTER slices it over the leaping short third man ! BOWLER despairs but they all count END START0 START1 START2 START3 [ wolf whistles ] look at the bottom hand on that ! Decent delivery , right up on the toes , but he whips the wrists through a bullet of a drive to cow ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 full outside off , BATTER hammers a drive which skips off a dry patch on the square and hurdles the dive of the fielder - nothing he could do to stop that and it races to the rope ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 find the edge but this will run away ! Another leaky old over from END START0 START1 START2 START3 filthy , a wide half-tracker , BATTER blaps it through backward point - poor follow up after that wicket ball to END START0 START1 START2 START3 a little reverse scoop down to boundary END START0 START1 START2 START3 that was a lovely pull to the boundary . A short ball and he 's dealt with that in punishing fashion END START0 START1 START2 START3 that looked effortless from BATTER , as it often does , pure timing has sent that to the rope , down the ground on the off-side END START0 START1 START2 START3 that one was better from BATTER , slapped backward of point to the rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 slapped imperiously away to the boundary and that brings up fifty for the captain END START0 START1 START2 START3 nicely lofted over mid-wicket and it trickles to the boundary rope END START0 START1 START2 START3 hes swept that beautifully to the boundary , got low down under it and hit it with real power off one knee END START0 START1 START2 START3 he 's chipped that away for four over deep mid-wicket END START0 START1 START2 START3 that was a strong sweep to the boundary and that 's his 30th fifty in ODIs ... it took him just 37 balls to get there ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 not a bad ball , but BATTER is coming forward like a middleweight boxer off his stool , belted on the up through cover and the man in the deep fails to cut it off - a dive might have helped END START0 START1 START2 START3 pitched up and drilled down the ground ! Beautifully struck , coming forwards and right out of the middle for four more ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 bit of grip , takes the edge playing back ... but that 's going to be four more ! No luck here for BOWLER , just deflected past FIELDER 's gloves END START0 START1 START2 START3 cute from BATTER ! Goes for the reverse-paddle and gets it away fine , think it came off the edge but zipped past keeper and then outran short third man to the rope ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 round the wicket , darted in on the pads and BATTER flicks it away fine for another boundary ... END START0 START1 START2 START3 feeding him runs now ...

END START0 START1 START2 START3 the best of the lot ! Width , wassocked through the covers ... barely moves his feet , just sinuously leans into the stroke like a mating snake END START0 START1 START2 START3 crushed through the covers again ! He is so dominant through the off side , but that one should have been cut off at short cover . No dive from FIELDER .... no stopping it END START0 START1 START2 START3 punched on the up , and whistles through the covers again ! That was a much better ball , better length , tighter line , but still just too much room for BATTER to free his arms END START0 START1 START2 START3 full and wide , spanked through point ! You do n't want to be bowling there ... ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 full on leg stump , sweeps hard , and nails it through square leg and away for four !
