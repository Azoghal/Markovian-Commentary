START0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length , BATTER makes room for himself and steers down to third on the cut to retain the strike ... hold on , no he does n't , it 's a no-ball ! Big overstep from END START0 START1 START2 START3 too short again , but the sweeper is back for this one , another chop into the covers . Uh oh , it 's an overstep , and a free hit ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 back of a length outside off , slashed to third man ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 length ball on off stump , shows the full face to push to the left of mid-on . And he 's overstepped for a second time . Not massive , but the heel is past the line when it lands ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 rolls the wrists on an open-faced drive to deep point , and that 's an overstep according to the third ump , whose job it is to check the front foot now . Free hit coming up ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 agh , another high full toss , that 'll be a no-ball and maybe the game for Ireland ... BATTER kept his head and swung it away for one into the deep , too END START0 START1 START2 START3 shortish and jabbed down into the leg side ... belatedly called a no-ball by the third umpire , too . More than four outside the circle , is the theory , according to ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 that 's a no-ball . Finn 's law applies ! He 's knocked the bail over , and they 've got a run down to third man ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 slapped away to cow corner ... and now BOWLER has overstepped END START0 START1 START2 START3 another high full toss , BATTER does well to shovel it through square - that 's another no-ball END START0 START1 START2 START3 full toss , BATTER pushes out and gets a thick edge into the covers - but called a no-ball on height , though that looked a tad harsh on replay ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 high full toss , top-edged and taken at third man ! But this is very likely to be a no-ball ... yep , a notch above waist height , I reckon . The umpires agree , and here comes a free hit ! END START0 START1 START2 START3 wide line , it 's a no-ball so a free hit coming up ! Slogged through the leg side , one bounce to deep midwicket ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 short , pulled , gathered at deep midwicket . Oops , a free hit coming up ... that 's not going to help the morale out there ... ENDSTART0 START1 START2 START3 shortish on the hip and tucked to midwicket ... but BOWLER had overstepped END
