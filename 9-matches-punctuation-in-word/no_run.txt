Moeen defends watchfully END START0 START1 angled into the pads from a fullish length, and Moeen is hit on the pad. No real appeal, always sliding down the leg side END START0 START1 banged in, Moeen steers to backward point and sets off but is sent back by Root END START0 START1 full and straight, driven back to the bowler END START0 START1 full on off stump, steered to backward point with an open face END START0 START1 pressed out to cover point END START0 START1 back of a length, worked uppishly towards short midwicket END START0 START1 width outside off, and Moeen under-edges the cut, not too far away from his own stumps! END START0 START1 full on off stump, driven straight back down the ground and BOWLER gets down to field END START0 START1 full outside off, pressed straight to mid-off END START0 START1 back of a length, Moeen defends with soft hands. 75mph/122kph END START0 START1 length ball, 75mph/121kph as he runs his fingers down the side of the ball.

Robinson says no! Sri Lanka review without much hesitation. Touch and go on two fronts: did it pitch outside leg stump, and was it too high? Clearly beat him on the inside edge, nipping back in towards the pads. Ball-tracking says... bit of a hold up... here we go: pitched outside leg. Review lost END START0 START1 angled across him again, left alone END START0 START1 angled across him, cut away to backward point on the bounce END START0 START1 angled across him, back of a length.

BATTER trying to pierce the cover ring to no avail just yet END START0 START1 attempted cut once more, can't time the glide into the covers END START0 START1 chopped off the back foot, into the covers END START0 START1 edged and dropped! Oh my word, Captain Fantastic blinks at the key moment! In the channel on off stump, a regulation nick, low to the keeper's left, but he sticks out a single mitt, and down it goes! Huge moment! END START0 START1 attempted pull, can't time it as the ball is onto him quickly END START0 START1 well bowled, fast and tight to off stump, drawing a sturdy block to the back-of-a-length delivery END START0 START1 firmly into line to defend, another tidy over ticked off END START0 START1 pushed off the front foot into the off side END START0 START1 very full length, and blocked back down the pitch END START0 START1 left alone outside off END START0 START1 a gallop and thwack from BATTER Misses everything, but he fancied a piece of that, back of a length outside off END START0 START1 curling past the outside edge, pushed across the stumps END START0 START1 whipped off the pads to the on-side, can't beat the field END START0 START1 driven off the front foot to mid-off END START0 START1 up on the toes, and punched to cover END START0 START1 high-elbowed push back through the line END START0 START1 fuller length this time, BATTER unleashes the drive, but mid-off pounces END START0 START1 shape back into the left-hander, a bit of nip from back of a length. This has been a good follow-up to the wickets. Asking the right questions and demanding respect END START0 START1 a shimmy out of the crease, but another good-length delivery, dabbed to cover END START0 START1 guided out to point, just back of a length, angled into the off stump END START0 START1 pops off the splice, bending the back on a tight line to the left-hander END START0 START1 over the wicket, blocked on the back foot into the off side END START0 START1 full length, outside off, left well alone END START0 START1 squared up on an off-stump line, patted back down the pitch END START0 START1 leg-stump line, poked to the on-side END START0 START1 very full, and pressed with a kneeling stance to cover END START0 START1 well bowled, right up to the blockhole from over the wicket, and solidly dabbed to point END START0 START1 outside off, no stroke offered END START0 START1 better line and length, and blocked respectfully END START0 START1 better line, just back of a length, squeezed back down the pitch in defence END START0 START1 genuine edge, but falls short of the solitary slip. Up on the toes to block the tight line END START0 START1 tighter line, bit of lift from back of a length, fenced with a hop into the off side END START0 START1 panned hard off the full length, up off the deck and straight back at BOWLER's outstretched hand END START0 START1 nibble back into the pads, too high for the lbw but that's a taxing line, straightening off the pitch on a good length END START0 START1 good length from over the wicket, drawing a high-elbowed stride to the pitch of the ball END START0 START1 advancing to the pitch, can't get it away as square leg gathers. A decent recovery in that over END START0 START1 in between length, just back of a length with a hint of seam movement. Defended END START0 START1 back of a length, inside-edged defence into the pads END START0 START1 length ball on the hip, worked down to long leg but they turn down the single END START0 START1 attempts the dipping slower-ball, but it comes out as a knee-high full toss.

END START0 START1 full, dug out into the off side END START0 START1 pressed to point with an open face END START0 START1 fullish on the pads, half-hearted appeal from bowler and keeper, but pitched outside leg stump. Or did it? Morgan reviews. Don't think there was any bat on it, and it hit him on the knee roll so height shouldn't be an issue. Ooh, hold on, there's a little tickle on the inside edge! BATTER survives. END START0 START1 defended to short cover END START0 START1 inside-edged into the pad, Bairstow appeals but BOWLER doesn't bother. Looked a touch high, too END START0 START1 back of a length, 89mph/144kph, and Chameera draws the hands inside the line END START0 START1 banged in short, and BATTER fends it away towards square leg, taking his bottom hand off the glove, suggesting it might have been hit END START0 START1 ...and slip puts down the catch! Root is the man there, diving to his right. Loose waft from BATTER, no foot movement, playing away from his body. BOWLER locates the outside edge, and Root is diving to his right, but puts it down END START0 START1 banged in, back of a length, defended awkwardly via the glove. 87mph/140kph END START0 START1 short ball, over the left shoulder as BATTER ducks.

More clear-cut call of no that time END START0 START1 outside off, BOWLER tumbles in his followthrough as this one is left alone END START0 START1 wafty outside off, can't connect END START0 START1 blocked from under the eyeline into the covers... I swear I heard a "run, big lad, run!" from an England fielder, capitalising on the headless chicken-ness going on out there END START0 START1 curl into the legs as BOWLER comes over the wicket with his inswinging line END START0 START1 stabbed into the off side END START0 START1 jammed into the covers, and another chaotic piece of running! No idea of who is calling, when or where. For future reference, Billings prowling at backward point tends to be a "hell no!" END START0 START1 pop from a good length as BOWLER comes round the wicket, rattled on the splice END START0 START1 hustled on a fuller length, pressed to the on-side END START0 START1 sizzling speed on a good length...

Jabbed to the off side with a hurried adjustment END START0 START1 back of a length, very tight line, solid in defence on the back foot END START0 START1 clattered into the covers, fine strike but straight at the fielder END START0 START1 slower ball, back of a length, pushed across the left-hander. Blocked END START0 START1 squeezed off a tight line and good length, down into the crease END START0 START1 on the back foot, pressed back down the pitch END START0 START1 googly, zips into the pads but turning down as BATTER closes his bat on it in the nick of time END START0 START1 chopped off the back foot out to cover END START0 START1 pops from a good length once more, Curran's finding awkward lift at times on off stump END START0 START1 up on the toes, jabbed down to backward point END START0 START1 zip and bounce, this one explodes away from the right-hander, sticking to over the wicket to mix up the angles END START0 START1 tapped to the leg side END START0 START1  END START0 START1 round the wicket, and poked with a full face into the covers. That's a fine over END START0 START1 firmly forward, head over the ball END START0 START1 dip and wobble on a beautiful length, BATTER can't lay a bat on it as that squeaks past the top of off! END START0 START1 zinger! Outside off, holding its line on a perfect length, and taking advantage of some tentative footwork to burst past the edge END START0 START1 clobbered on the bicep by Curran! He's not express, but he's getting some very awkward lift from a good length, and that's right on the fleshy part, scrambled seam biting the pitch and launching as BATTER gets in a tangle END START0 START1 full-length legbreak, zippy pace, chopped to gully END START0 START1 banged in short, lifts past the upraised bat as BATTER opts out of an uppercut END START0 START1 round the wicket again, nip away from the right-hander, on a full length, poked to point END START0 START1 nip from a full length, from over the wicket, that tucks BATTER up as he hops back into his crease, wearing that on the fingers, and the physio is out to assess the damage END START0 START1 tidy finish to the over, another googly, just back of a length, and dabbed with the turn to midwicket END START0 START1 googly to the well-set BATTER, nudged into the covers END START0 START1 every one a coconut in that over, BATTER can only hop into line on off stump and press a defensive block to cover END START0 START1 this is hustly, bustly pace from BOWLER, back of a length, wide on the crease, angle into the right-hander and sharp lift through to the keeper END START0 START1 beaten once more, whistling through to the keeper from a good length END START0 START1 sharp pace once again, 90mph as BATTER jabs and misses outside off END START0 START1 wheels outside off, just back of a length with zippy seam movement.

Can't lay bat on ball END START0 START1 beauty! How did that not clip off stump?! BATTER played all round this. Round the wicket, sharp movement off the seam to take it away from the bat as he looks to work to leg, and just misses the top of off END START0 START1 wide on the crease again, drags his length back. 91mph/146kph, and BATTER sways inside the line END START0 START1 wide on the crease, skiddy length, steered to backward point END START0 START1 banged in halfway down, pressed out to cover on the back foot. 89mph/144kph END START0 START1 angling in from a length, inside-edged towards mid-on END START0 START1 back of a length, BATTER rides the bounce and defends.

Yep, not even umpire's call on impact, so SL lose that one END START0 START1 glides to the crease, pitches this up at 87mph/140kph, driven coming forwards but straight to mid-off END START0 START1 keeps him back, this angles in a touch, BATTER drops the bat and chops into his body END START0 START1 touch back of a length on off stump, BATTER shows it a straight bat END START0 START1 banged in short, BATTER backs away shaping to uppercut but can't lay bat on ball END START0 START1 yorker, angled across him, and Binura can't lay bat on ball trying to squeeze it down towards deep third END START0 START1 banged in short, and Binura flaps at the pull, failing to get bat on ball END START0 START1 another slower ball, cross-batted straight to Morgan at extra cover END START0 START1 legcutter, wide outside off stump, can't lay bat on ball END START0 START1 back of the hand slower ball, hacked back to Curran in his follow-through END START0 START1 back of a length, slower ball, inside-edged into the hip and it skews out towards point END START0 START1 half an appeal for caught behind, but Morgan decides again the review. Shaped to hit over midwicket, across the line.

Beats his outside edge END START0 START1 comes forward to block BOWLER's last ball into the covers END START0 START1 makes a mess of it while trying to nudge to leg. Skews up towards the vacant short leg area of the pad, and Bairstow comes forward to field on the bounce END START0 START1 short ball, over the left shoulder.

But it's given as a dot, which means BOWLER finishes with a maiden, and 0 for 35 from his 10 END START0 START1 fullish outside off, steered to point END START0 START1 sharp bounce from back of a length, fenced out to point. 86mph/138kph and BOWLER hits the deck in his follow-through again.

He wonders if this should be a wide, but it was tight enough to the leg stump, according to the umpire END START0 START1 full, angling in towards off stump, driven to mid-off END START0 START1 slammed into the pitch on a good length, worked to mid-on. 86mph/138kph END START0 START1 beaten.

Lone appeal from Bairstow, but I think this missed the boot and hit the toe of the bat END START0 START1 leading edge, which falls just short of Wood at short third. Legbreak, turning away from the bat, as BATTER looked to work into the leg side END START0 START1 cross-batted flash at a wide-ish length ball. No contact. 88mph/142kph END START0 START1 wide on the crease, sharp bouncer, and BATTER sways out the line of it END START0 START1 banged in just short of a length, nudged to short midwicket END START0 START1 punched back to BOWLER on the back foot END START0 START1 no real turn, defended back to the bowler END START0 START1 full and straight, nudged back to BOWLER END START0 START1 length ball outside off, bottom-edged into the off side END START0 START1 length ball, pressed to mid-on END START0 START1 a fraction short of a length, punched to short cover END START0 START1 hard length, punched to short cover END START0 START1 skiddy length ball, clipped into the leg side END START0 START1 short ball, which flies harmlessly over the ducking BATTER's left shoulder END START0 START1 length ball, defended to short midwicket END START0 START1 defended to short midwicket, riding the bounce END START0 START1 angling in towards off stump, clipped to short midwicket END START0 START1 good bounce from a length, as BATTER defends towards mid-off END START0 START1 steered out to point with an open face END START0 START1 angled across him, and beats BATTER's outside edge as he has a waft outside off END START0 START1 angled across him, defended back down the pitch END START0 START1 slower ball, full outside off, BATTER shuffles across to defend END START0 START1 short ball, which DdS sways inside the line of END START0 START1 extra bounce out the back of the hand, fended out to cover point END START0 START1 wide slower ball, hung full outside the off stump, and DdS is down on one knee, looking to go up and over mid-off. He swings at thin air, and Bairstow takes it cleanly END START0 START1 angling into the right-hander, who dabs down to backward point. Slower ball, which nipped back into the batter END START0 START1 over the wicket again, another bumper and this time BATTER swings at it and misses END START0 START1 good length, defended on off stump END START0 START1 attempts to heave this leg side, edged on to the thigh pad and it only just clears the bails! Doesn't quite carry to Bairstow, either. Pace on from Curran and it nearly does for BATTER END START0 START1 definitely a slower ball this time, angled towards short third man and BATTER is forced to reach for his ground as Wood has a shy END START0 START1 pitched up and driven along the carpet to mid-off END START0 START1 goes back and across and punches into the covers, Morgan swoops on it END START0 START1 fullish, 89mph/143kph and stabbed towards backward point END START0 START1 dug in short and DdS almost gets into a tangle, pops off the splice and lands safely on the leg side END START0 START1 BOWLER fires this in straight, Dasun blocks coming across his stumps END START0 START1 tight lines, defended towards point END START0 START1 length ball wide of the off stump, BATTER allows this one through END START0 START1 dragged down slightly and BATTER swipes hard across the line, picks out mid-on END START0 START1 tossed up and patted away in front of the stumps END START0 START1 flighted, spins into the pads as BATTER comes down, YJB blurts an exploratory appeal. Nothing doing END START0 START1 pushed through on the stumps, tapped leg side END START0 START1 short of a length outside off, steered down towards point END START0 START1 nearly foxes him with the googly!

That actually bounced and hit Stokes low on the shin, just above the ankle. END START0 START1 wider outside off and very full, he gets down low to try and drive it but can't connect. Looked like a slower ball, with S Curran having rolled his fingers over the ball END START0 START1 fullish on off, comes on the front foot and drives to mid-on END START0 START1 fuller and well clear of offstump, left alone END START0 START1 dropped at point but difficult chance. Rasping cut to a short and wide ball outside off, and Roy flew to his left and got a hand to it, but could only block it, not catch it. He was quick to release it to the keeper, and BATTER had to scramble back END START0 START1 back of a length on a fourth stump line, BATTER cuts it from close to his body but can't beat point END START0 START1 good length on the stumps, he's looking to punch this through mid-off, gets an inside edge onto pad END START0 START1 fuller and wide outside off, moving further away, left alone END START0 START1 back of a length, keeping it tight on off, Rohit was looking to tap it softly and run but the ball bounces down to the slips END START0 START1 struck on the pad and loud appeal. Not given, and they aren't reviewing. Pitched on off, and went in slightly, BATTER was playing outside the line and struck high on the pad. Would have gone over END START0 START1 dug in short and coming into him on off, he was dancing down the track and ends up having to pat it down from chest height END START0 START1 length on a sixth stump line outside off, left alone END START0 START1 beaten. Back of a length in the channel, straightens past his attempted punch through off. Back to back maiden overs for England END START0 START1 fuller on the stumps, angling into him, defended towards point with an angled bat END START0 START1 he's copped a blow on the right glove. This one straightens off a hard length on middle stump and Rohit is squared up trying to defend, the ball bounces more than he thought it would. he's actually worn it on the forearm, near the elbow as he couldn't get bat up in time. Speed on that one was 148 kph. END START0 START1 back of a length on off, tapped to cover. The fielder's rushing in and they quickly decide there's no quick single to be had - wisely so. END START0 START1 moves away again. This one is bowled fuller and wider outside off, Rohit shapes to drive it through off but checks his shot and allows the ball to go past. Wasn't full enough to drive END START0 START1 length ball on the stumps and nipping away, solidly defended into the offside END START0 START1 tight lines from Curran, very close to off stump but BATTER is sure of where his off stump is and shoulders arms END START0 START1 this one comes back in to BATTER now, from a length. He's looking to work it away but is struck on the pads and the ball rolls into the offside END START0 START1 near-yorker on off stump, squirted out to mid-off END START0 START1 getting consistent movement is Curran - much like Wood. Shapes away from BATTER outside off, on a fourth-fifth stump line and left alone END START0 START1 good length on a fourth stump line, left alone END START0 START1 fuller on off, tapped to cover. Billings got the ball straight to him but lost balance while fielding it and slipped. No harm done though END START0 START1 full outside off, and going away with the angle, left alone END START0 START1 through him. BOWLER brings this one back in from a hard length outside off. BATTER looking to cut it, and the ball moves into him, don't think he was expecting that. Goes under his arm and to the keeper. END START0 START1 good line and on a hard length, moving across BATTER He can let it go safely because even though it's close to off stump, it'll sail over the stumps END START0 START1 good length, keeps it in the channel and is still getting it to nip away, left alone again END START0 START1 good length, moving away in the channel, left alone END START0 START1 rapped on the pads first up, but not given. They don't review. Length ball, moves across Rohit, might have just pitched outside leg, and perhaps hit him a bit high too END START0 START1 length on leg stump, tucked to square leg. Loud and early call of 'NO' because the fielder was swooping in on it END START0 START1 zips past the outside edge of BATTER this time, pitches on leg and moves away. Wood's got it to move both ways this over. BATTER keeps bat close to bat as the ball goes past END START0 START1 beaten. Nips away from a hard length on a fourth stump line and whistles past Rohit's outside edge as he's looking to punch END START0 START1 digs it in short and rising to Rohit's ribs on off, he taps it down off the back foot END START0 START1 back of a length, well outside off, left alone ENDSTART0 START1 another bouncer, over off stump this time, he was shaping to pull but had to sway out of the way and drop his hands END START0 START1 bouncer over the stumps, he arches his back to get out of the way and let it go through END START0 START1 under-edge bounces to the keeper's right, towards slip. Pant dives across and lands a bit heavily on his chest, though he stops the ball. Short outside off, he was looking for a big wind up and an almighty pull, but only under-edged it down. END START0 START1 nails the yorker again, on off stumps, jams his bat down in time as the ball trickles back to the bowler END START0 START1 yorker on off, but this is dealt with well, straight bat offered as it's dug out straight past the bowler END START0 START1 zipping across him at good pace, he's beaten looking to run it down to third man END START0 START1 back of a length in the channel, too close to cut and he can't connect END START0 START1 good length on leg stump and nipping across him, patted back down the pitch END START0 START1 back of a length going across him, hops while pushing it to cover END START0 START1 length ball going across him, beats his attempted steer to third man END START0 START1 fuller on the stumps, pushed towards extra cover END START0 START1 length ball going across him, tapped towards point END START0 START1 bouncer going over leg stump, he was moving inside the line and tried to pull, but it got big on him and went over his bat END START0 START1 length outside off, googly spinning away, slapped to cover END START0 START1 tossed up on the stumps, gets a thickish edge that rolls to point while driving END START0 START1 full outside off, shimmies down the track and defends to cover END START0 START1 back of a length on off, defended to point END START0 START1 good length on a tight line on off, defended to the bowler's left END START0 START1 a defensive shot! Length and tight around off, patted back to the bowler with a straight bat END START0 START1 fuller on off, steered to point. END START0 START1 has he been caugh behindt? The Indians aren't celebrating at all. The soft signal is not out too. This was a great ball to finish the over, a near yorker on a fifth stump line. BATTER clearing his front leg to give himself room gets a thin edge on it, and Pant flies to his right to catch it. But the ball hit the ground immediately after BATTER edged it. So not out. END START0 START1 length ball nipping into him, BATTER can be forgiven for thinking he just has to swing bat and get six, this time it thuds into his thigh pad END START0 START1 length ball into him, defended. Whoa, that's radical END START0 START1 A horrible drag-down to finish the over, but BATTER scuffs his pull to short backward square. Ugh... poor chap. That has to be his work done, surely. END START0 START1 banged in short, BATTER ducks. He's in no rush, clearly END START0 START1 fenced to midwicket with a high elbow END START0 START1 thrashed into the covers. And that will be drinks BOWLER in particular will need one after that END START0 START1 back of a length, pumped to mid-off off the back foot END START0 START1 poked back to the bowler, stopped in the pitch, and inches short of a catch END START0 START1 back and across, cut to cover END START0 START1 good riposte. An in-between length and a tighter line, BATTER falls forward in his bid to get his push away END START0 START1 tucked to the leg side. BATTER is on 94 once more... END START0 START1 on the back foot, zipping through a touch quicker and pushed to cover END START0 START1 tossed up, and dipping on a full length, blocked back down the pitch END START0 START1 open face, attempted glide through third man, but short third man is in situ to gather END START0 START1 outside off, and BATTER can't connect on the cut... might be wise to sit on this over rather than give it away. He's got his boundary off India's best bowler END START0 START1 attempted pull, not quite there for the shot, and under-edged into the crease END START0 START1 a better follow-up, nipping back off the seam and inside-edged into the pads END START0 START1 short ball, grrr! Aggression to finish the over END START0 START1 on the back foot, flipped to short midwicket END START0 START1 tucked to the leg side, can't get this one away END START0 START1 punched hard back to the bowler END START0 START1 shaping away from the left-hander, and through to the keeper END START0 START1 full-faced punch, back through the line END START0 START1 tighter line, punched off the back foot into the covers END START0 START1 opens the face, for a glide to third man END START0 START1 attempted ramp, but can't connect as he falls away to the off side, seeking the lift over the keeper's head. BOWLER as aniticipated has done a good job to cramp BATTER style in that over END START0 START1 oof, that zinged through! BATTER is beaten for pace as the cross-seamer skids past his half-formed clip to leg END START0 START1 short, wide, crashed hard through point, but Rahul springs into action to intercept END START0 START1 outside off, and through to the keeper END START0 START1 a swish at a loopy leg-stump delivery, flicks the pads as the bat comes through END START0 START1 firm face of the bat, on the front foot, and blocked END START0 START1 good riposte, hitting the seam, and the inside-edge, with a nipbacker on a fuller length END START0 START1 round the wicket, probing length, blotted into the covers on the front foot END START0 START1 flashed hard to mid-off, in BATTER arc but fractionally too wide for him to get any power through the stroke END START0 START1 banged in short and that takes off through to the keeper. END START0 START1 wider line, a firm crack of the willow through point, but more sharp fielding to crank up the pressure on BATTER END START0 START1 advancing to the pitch, blocked with intent back to the bowler, who adjusted his length well END START0 START1 on the back foot, blotted down into the crease END START0 START1 high elbow, punched to long-on END START0 START1 flicked off the pads to midwicket END START0 START1 dipping into the toes, nudged to the on-side END START0 START1 jabbed to the on-side, a loud no from Stokes as England risk another run-out there.... careful now! END START0 START1 over the wicket, tight lines with the wristy action on the ball. BATTER is cautiously but firmly forward END START0 START1 fully forward, and poked to the off-side END START0 START1  END START0 START1 looped onto a teasing full length, BATTER stretches over the ball to squeeze it to cover END START0 START1 raucous appeal for the lbw! No shot offered from BATTER, and it might have been the left-armer's wrong'un, turning back into the left-hander's knee-roll. Outside the line, but that's non-applicable in this case... nope, missing by a distance. Review lost! END START0 START1 length on off, punched to point END START0 START1 good length on off, steers it towards point, staying legside of the ball END START0 START1 length on off, punched back to the bowler. END START0 START1 chopped towards point END START0 START1 beaten and that has taken off after passing the batsman. Pant has to leap up high to gather. Back of a length outside off, jagging away past the outside edge as he tries to punch END START0 START1 connects with the reverse sweep well to a fullish ball on leg stump, but hits it straight to short third man END START0 START1 length on middle, spinning into him again, he's making room, ends up jabbing it back to the bowler END START0 START1 beaten. Tossed up on the stumps and spinning sharply into him, he was looking to punch through the legside, but is rapped on the pads END START0 START1 back of a length on off, defended END START0 START1 fullish on the stumps, driven to mid-on END START0 START1 length ball on a tight line around off, punched on the front foot, but Kohli at cover is swooping on it to his right this time END START0 START1 back of a length outside off, punched to cover's left, who tumbles and fields END START0 START1 good length on the stumps comes on the front foot and nudges it to midwicket END START0 START1 beaten and there's an appeal but the umpire's not moved. Tossed up on off, and spinning into him, he's tried to fetch the sweep shot from there and doesn't connect. Struck on the rib, but outside the line END START0 START1 a bit shorter outside off, stays back and cuts, but can't beat point END START0 START1 tossed up on off, comes on the front foot to get to the pitch and pushes to cover END START0 START1 fuller, coming into him, punched to mid-on END START0 START1 too short outside off, cuts it powerfully, but straight to point END START0 START1 back of a length outside off, he's moving across and tucks it to midwicket's right. No single because the fielder was moving quickly and swooped on the ball END START0 START1 length on the stumps, defended into the legside END START0 START1 length, on a tight line on off, pushed to mid-off END START0 START1 fuller on the stumps, pushed back to the bowler's right. END START0 START1 brings it into him again, and YJB misses connecting again, but struck well outside off this time END START0 START1 big shout for lbw not given. That looked really close, maybe impact outside off? Beautifully bowled by BOWLER, who brought it back in and through the gap between bat and pad as BATTER was looking to drive. Replays show that hit in line but would have been umpire's call on hitting the top of the stumps END START0 START1 length outside off, glides it off his bat to point END START0 START1 length ball coming into him, punched to mid-off END START0 START1 fuller on a sixth stump line, swinging away, he goes to drive, but gets an inside edge that goes towards short leg END START0 START1 back of a length outside off, punched off the backfoot, but not timed that well. Cover gathers END START0 START1 fuller and into him, cuts it to cover END START0 START1 good length on middle, comes forward with a straight bat and defends back to the bowler END START0 START1 gets it on a length and in the channel, BATTER lets it go through. Good carry through to Pant END START0 START1 hits a better length now, not short as before and gets it to bounce a bit more than just sitting up too. BATTER looking to pull again, cops it on the mid-riff off a bottom edge END START0 START1 sharp bouncer outside off, he was looking to pull but had to drop his hands and sway out of the way END START0 START1 given width outside off and he stands up tall to crash it through cover, but Kohli does well there to time his dive to his right to stop the ball END START0 START1 too full and driven fluidly again, but straight to the fielder in the covers END START0 START1 straight drive pings off the bowler's foot. This was hit even harder than the one Roy hit at the start of the over, but bullet straight and hits the bowler's right ankle on his follow through, pings towards cover END START0 START1 goes straighter and fuller this time, tapped towards midwicket END START0 START1 just short of a diving Virat Kohli at cover. BATTER had no idea about that. Pitched on a length and jagged away with appreciable bounce too, BATTER was left with bat hanging and pushing at it. Takes the shoulder of the bat to loop in the air. Kohli charges in from cover and dives full length but the ball is millimetres short of his fingertips END START0 START1 swing and a miss. This one moves away from back of a length, he's wanted to flay it through cover with feet static, doesn't connect END START0 START1 fullish on off, driven to point by opening the bat face END START0 START1 beaten. He was expecting it to come in, bowled in the channel but this one held it's line - seam pointing fine leg so he was right to play for the one swinging in perhaps - went to drive and the ball hisses past the outside edge. END START0 START1 length ball close to off, this time it's coming in - BOWLER's skill on display - and BATTER pushes it to mid-on END START0 START1 squared him up. Swinging into him, pitches on leg and straightens up, rolls into the offside off the outside half of the bat END START0 START1 fuller and closer to off, crisply punched, but straight to mid-off END START0 START1 back of a length on a sixth stump line, pushed to point END START0 START1 closer to off stump this time, defended with a straight bat, back to the bowler END START0 START1 full and well wide of off again, BATTER shows he would have endeared himself to Daenerys Targaryen by bending the knee again, and driving to mid-off END START0 START1 floated up full and wide of off, goes to drive it, bending his knee but can only toe-end it to mid-off END START0 START1 moving slightly forward and across, but BOWLER's tight lines means he can't do much more than nudge it to square leg END START0 START1 good length outside off again, pushed to mid-on END START0 START1 tight line around off, on a hard length, he's moving across a bit, nudges it into the legside END START0 START1 back of a length outside off, slashed to point END START0 START1 Well bowled, aiming for the tramlines with the wide yorker, and nailing it this time. In spite of the rain (reign?) of sixes, this has been okay from England so far... END START0 START1 banged in short, round the wicket, aiming for the tramlines, and that beats a wild uppercut. Good delivery END START0 START1 edged and dropped! Oh dear, Buttler juggles the chance, high to his right, as BATTER toe-ends a wide delivery, he almost grabbed it on the rebound... how costly will that be? END START0 START1 Curran gets out of it this time, zipping through an ambitious wind-up for Buttler to gather END START0 START1 well, that flicked something ... but it's pad, as BATTER misses down the leg-side and Buttler grabs optimistically END START0 START1 tight line, a defensive jab back through the line, down the pitch END START0 START1 banged in short, and given as caught behind! But BATTER has reviewed immediately! A decent bouncer, but it hits the forearm as BATTER is late on the pull, then deflects onto the helmet! Buttler's appeal was inquisitive rather than assured. Not out! END START0 START1 a swish across the line, BATTER had shaped to the off-side, so no wide as the ball slides past his legs. END START0 START1 BATTER is lbw, in a massive tangle of limbs! He lined up a wild reverse-ramp-sweep, come what may... but he's under-edged that through fine leg! BATTER has reviewed, and rightly so! But unfortunately for BATTER, this is a dead ball instead of a boundary! I look forward to that incident being the decisive factor in England's one-wicket win! END START0 START1 yee-haw! A huge whoosh of the bat outside off, as a cutter fizzes past Pant's intentions END START0 START1 hitting the deck hard outside off, and pushed to the off side END START0 START1 thumped off a full length, gathered at mid-on END START0 START1 full this time, angled into the toes from round the wicket, and pushed to point END START0 START1 googly to finish, a bit of grip outside off as BATTER elects to leave alone. He's not flicked the ignition switch just yet END START0 START1 patted back to the bowler with an exploratory drive END START0 START1 looped onto a good length, gentle turn on the legbreak, pushed to point END START0 START1 flatter on the pads, flicked to midwicket END START0 START1 fuller on off, gently tickled to midwicket END START0 START1 tossed up on the stumps, defended END START0 START1  END START0 START1 length ball angling into him, comes forward and pats it back down the pitch END START0 START1 comes on the front foot to push it but this turns a bit and hits him on the front pad flap END START0 START1 length outside off, he's on the front foot and looking to steer through point but doesn't get enough on it END START0 START1 fuller on the stumps, punched to mid-on END START0 START1 tapped to mid-on END START0 START1 length ball on off, turning away, BATTER a bit early into the shot as the ball plops in front of him and to BOWLER's right, who dives and saves END START0 START1 length on the stumps, flicked to square leg END START0 START1 quicker, at 93.7 kph, BATTER goes back and defends in front of off stump END START0 START1 fuller, driven to extra cover END START0 START1 googly spinning into him, punched off the back foot to mid-on, Stokes dives to his left and intercepts after sprinting across from midwicket quickly END START0 START1 was dancing down the track, Moeen saw it and bowled it flat and short. He had to adjust and work it to square leg END START0 START1 fullish on the stumps, comes on the front foot and pushes gently back down the pitch END START0 START1 back of a length on a tight line around off, chopped towards point END START0 START1 length on off, punched to cover END START0 START1 nicely tossed up on the stumps and draws a solid forward defensive from BATTER END START0 START1 length ball on middle, spinning down, BATTER misses the flick as it trickles to the keeper off the pad. He's upset with himself, there were runs for the taking there END START0 START1 steered to point, he wants the single but is sent back. END START0 START1 clipped to midwicket END START0 START1 length on middle, turning away, goes back and tucks to square leg END START0 START1 seemed to grip on the pitch a bit, and BATTER had to check his push after pressing forward, ends up bunting it back to the bowler END START0 START1 was coming down the track but Moeen sticks to his back-of-length outside off line and BATTER is cramped for room a bit, punching to midwicket's left END START0 START1 good length outside off, has to stretch forward and clip to mid-on END START0 START1 fuller again, he was perhaps expecting it to be shorter and was hanging back a bit, driven to extra cover END START0 START1 length on off, punched back to the bowler's left END START0 START1 length on the stumps, defended solidly on the front foot END START0 START1 length ball nipping into him, squirted towards point END START0 START1 full on the stumps, flicked to midwicket END START0 START1 fuller, tailing into him on middle and leg, played back towards the bowler from the outside half of the bat. Teensy bit squared up, was BATTER END START0 START1 worked to midwicket on the front foot, BATTER thinks there's a single there but Kohli sends him back. It's Jason Roy at midwicket who's been a ball of fire in the field END START0 START1 slightly shorter, he's surprised by the bounce and fends it back down the pitch END START0 START1 fuller outside off, worked to mid-on END START0 START1 outside off, fenced back down the line of the ball. Time for a drink END START0 START1 poked to cover with a full face of the bat END START0 START1 wafted back to the bowler, trying to manufacture an angle from another tight line. Excellent work so far from TK END START0 START1 another attempt at a quick single from BATTER but Kohli is leaning on his bat once more END START0 START1 full and straight, clipped back to the bowler with a curious hop in his followthrough, as if intimating that he wanted to give that some more humpty END START0 START1 very full again, swinging into the toes, and eased to the on-side END START0 START1 clipped to the on-side, BATTER wants the quick single but Kohli is going nowhere END START0 START1 very full, right up to the bat, and blocked out to the on-side END START0 START1 slower ball, on a good length outside off, and jabbed to cover. After that rocky first ball, Curran has served up two runs in 11 END START0 START1 that's a good length to BATTER, probing the stumps and forcing a response. Squared up on the back foot to defend END START0 START1 tight outside off, good carry through to the keeper, BATTER leaves alone END START0 START1 punched solidly into the covers END START0 START1 rolls the fingers on a fuller length, a firm drive through backward point, but an excellent one-handed intercept END START0 START1 back of a length, outside off, no stroke offered END START0 START1 good line outside off, probing length, left alone END START0 START1 shaping away outside off stump, left alone with a raise of the bat. A better finish to the over END START0 START1 fenced with hard hands, into the on-side, probing length from Curran END START0 START1 drags his length back, tight to an off-stump line, BATTER leans forward to defend END START0 START1 outside off, lifting through to the keeper END START0 START1 nudged to the on-side, better length on a tight line END START0 START1 dipping into the pads on a full length, and flicked to the on-side for mid-on to gather END START0 START1 very full to the new batsman, who comes forward to press to cover END START0 START1 lovely line, full length, and zipping past a half-cocked block on the front foot. Wobble seam from Curran END START0 START1 tucked off the pads to the man on the 45 END START0 START1 ... and he does, finding a fuller length and drawing a respectful block. It's been a decent comeback but I suspect his work is done for now END START0 START1 another loose one, short outside off, but thumped to short cover END START0 START1 back on a fuller length, outside off with a hint of swing END START0 START1 shape away from the right-hander, just back of a length, pushed to point. Tidy END START0 START1 full again, tight line, squeezed to midwicket with a closed face END START0 START1 back of a length, tight line, blocked down into the crease END START0 START1 drills the pad again on a leg-stump line. Very cramped on the left-arm angle. Disciplined work from BOWLER END START0 START1 thumps the pad, and a half an appeal from Topley... Buttler reckons that's sneaking past leg, and he's probably right. Pitched outside leg too. Apart from everything... pretty close END START0 START1 tight line outside off, Rohit leaves alone at the last minute. A quizzical look from Buttler, as if he heard a noise there END START0 START1 awkward half-length from BOWLER, Virat rides the extra bounce on the back foot, down into his crease END START0 START1 angled bat, into the slips on the bounce as Curran draws Rohit forward again END START0 START1 firmer on the front foot, pressed to cover END START0 START1 through to the keeper once more, a probing line outside off as Rohit is lured into a nibble at that one END START0 START1 full again, but a slightly wider line, hint of swing towards the cordon, blocked to cover END START0 START1 pushed into the covers, with a waft of the hands END START0 START1 back of a length, on the pads, clipped to the leg side. A fine over END START0 START1 excellent rhythm from BOWLER now, in the channel again and left alone END START0 START1 lovely line and lift... BATTER again flinches as the ball rises past his splice. Not a lot to do with those END START0 START1 width outside off, and BATTER is lured into a bit of a loose waft, feet not really moving on that occasion END START0 START1 fenced into the covers, more swing from a tight line as BATTER leans cautiously forward END START0 START1 very full, and blocked END START0 START1 attempted charge at the left-armer, who responds by dragging his length back and bangs it in shorter. Good riposte END START0 START1 shoulders arms as Curran bangs it in just back of a length, finds more outswing to compromise any attacking intent. This has been tight so far from England END START0 START1 drawn forward outside off, and punched into the covers END START0 START1 right up to the toes to finish an excellent comeback over, flicked to short midwicket END START0 START1 BATTER shuffles to leg, giving himself room on the cut, but that's too tight a line, and more extra bounce END START0 START1 excellent carry through to the keeper, outside off and lifting off the deck END START0 START1 outside off, good signs of swing on a wide line, lovely high action imparting some extra bounce too END START0 START1 outside off again, just inside the tram-lines, and again no stroke END START0 START1 slightly wider on this occasion, but an impeccable length once more. No stroke END START0 START1 lovely ball to the left-hander, right in the channel, curling around the outside edge from a three-and-a-half stump line END START0 START1 very full length, a hint of shape rather than swing, bending past the right-hander and blocked to mid-off ENDSTART0 START1 pumped to long-on, but it's India's game and series! END START0 START1 flogged to long-off, he missed his yorker, but BATTER missed his wind-up! It's do or die now... END START0 START1 not this time, another full ball, wide line, and BATTER drags to the leg side END START0 START1 right back on the stumps, BATTER looks for a flick, but that's too full and straight to work with END START0 START1 BATTER gives himself room to leg, BOWLER follows him. Good bowling, precious dot END START0 START1 plays miles inside the line to see off the main threat Outside off, bouncing through to the keeper. Now then. Curran back on strike. 19 from 12 is the equation! END START0 START1 very full, huge appeal, Bhuvi has the breakthrough! England review There did seem to be two sounds with BATTER well back on his stumps for the inswinger.. nope, no bat, but it's going to be a dead ball if this is going over... missing! END START0 START1 slower ball, good ball. BATTER blocks under his eyeline END START0 START1 fired past the leg stump, but flicks the pad along the way. No wide END START0 START1 another cutter, comes out as a long-hop, but BATTER's cut can't beat the sweeper this time... no run as he keeps the strike END START0 START1 rolling his wrists on a violent pull, but again can't find the gap on the leg side. Now there's a challenge for England. Nearly two a ball needed now END START0 START1 cracked hard down the ground but short of Rahul again. No single as BATTER bides his time, looking for the boundary END START0 START1 low full toss, effectively a yorker, as BATTER toe-ends a biff to wide mid-on END START0 START1 very full, lumped hard, to mid-on, a fine over as Curran declines the single to keep the strike END START0 START1 another wide cutter, might have been given if he'd left it, but BATTER toe-ends his pull to the leg side END START0 START1 jabbed off the pads... and this time BATTER wants the single and Wood won't go! Careful now... BOWLER sprints through to field. Misinformation between England's batsmen! END START0 START1 back of a length, clubbed into the leg side with a roll of the wrists. Wood thought the single was on, but was sent back from virtually BATTER's toes! END START0 START1 another excellent yorker, clubbed from a full length to long-off, and BATTER turns down the single. Challenging Nat to keep hitting his blockhole END START0 START1 much better yorker, BATTER was winding up again, but realised it was too pinpoint this time. Good nerve from the rookie END START0 START1 solid in defence from BATTER, onto the front foot. Just one off the over. Respect from England. Bhuvi has one over left... Kohli well might hold it back for an emergency. It's already a long shot with that run-rate surging now END START0 START1 very full again, nothing to drive on that length, BATTER blocks to long-off, and decides against the single. Protecting Wood too, maybe END START0 START1 compactly onto the front foot, solid defence. Respect from BATTER, who knows that as match-ups go, this isn't one of them! END START0 START1 driven off the back foot, and eludes the outside edge!

EDIT: Yep, Ultra-Edge confirms a little nick off the toe END START0 START1 clipped from off stump to square leg in the ring END START0 START1 inch-perfect yorker, which cleans him up!

Loops out of his reach in the end, but the threat is real END START0 START1 tight line and length again, good pace and hassle as BATTER blocks to cover END START0 START1 short and wide, cracked hard but straight at backward point. BATTER will feel he missed out there END START0 START1 tails in on a full length, worked with the angle into the leg side END START0 START1 props forward on the full length, jabbed to cover END START0 START1 Full length, on off stump, squeezed to the off side END START0 START1 firmly forward, tossed up outside the left-hander's off stump, and blocked END START0 START1 another doodlebug of a delivery, silently dipping towards the blockhole as Fakhar leans forward END START0 START1 shuffles at the crease and pushes to point as Parky finds more good areas on a full length END START0 START1 tossed up again, drawn forward, lots of lovely air to keep the batter waiting END START0 START1 back of a length, wicket-to-wicket, punched a touch high on the bat, and gathered at mid-off END START0 START1 tight lines once more as BATTER presses down the pitch END START0 START1 banged in short, outside off, Fakhar went for the big wind-up, but that was a pace-off ball and the timing was awry as cover gathered END START0 START1 back and across, open-faced defence to backward point END START0 START1 firmly forward, blocked down the track END START0 START1 probing areas again, "that's good mate, good mate" says Simpson, and he's not wrong END START0 START1 line, loop and length. Tidy stuff END START0 START1 lots of air on a dipping legbreak, thumps the pad but always outside leg END START0 START1 in behind the line, on a good length, blocked back down the pitch END START0 START1 on the back foot, poked into the covers, and more anxious running as Shadab is sent back this time END START0 START1 right back on the stumps to defend once more END START0 START1 forward to defend firmly down the track. Tidy lines from BOWLER END START0 START1 on the back foot, and punched back down the pitch END START0 START1 tidy areas to start, looped up onto a good length outside off and pushed to the off side END START0 START1 banged in short to finish, no stroke offered as the umpire decides that's fair enough on height END START0 START1 thumps the pad, angled down the leg side, hitting the deck hard once more END START0 START1 full length, pushed across the left-hander, tapped down the pitch END START0 START1 hits the splice from back of a length, fenced down into the crease END START0 START1 slower ball, defended back down the pitch from a length, and BOWLER fields in his follow-through END START0 START1 good bounce from a length, nudged into the leg side END START0 START1 fast offcutter, steered out to point END START0 START1 defended to backward point on the bounce, off the back foot END START0 START1 hangs back, defending into the off side END START0 START1 squeezed out to backward point off the back foot END START0 START1 banged in, 87mph/140kph, and BATTER gets a leading edge back down the pitch as he looks to turn it into the leg side END START0 START1 back of a length, inside-edged into the body and it spills away into the leg side. 86mph/139kph END START0 START1 hard length, defended to cover point off the back foot END START0 START1 bouncer, which flies through. 84mph/135kph, and hits Simpson's gloves hard as he stretches up to his left END START0 START1 lifter from back of a length. BATTER rides the bounce, and defends from under his eyes, via the glove, into the crease END START0 START1 sits up from a length, but BATTER's off drive can't beat mid-off END START0 START1 defended back down the pitch from a length END START0 START1 91mph/146kph but it slips out as a low full toss. BATTER drives, but can't beat cover END START0 START1 nibbles in off the seam, as BATTER defends from a length. 90mph/145kph END START0 START1 sharp bounce at 87mph/140kph to hit BATTER on the back thigh pad. Beats him for pace as BATTER looks to work to leg END START0 START1 gets in line, defending solidly to mid-off END START0 START1 hard length, defended towards mid-on. 82mph/132kph END START0 START1 fourth-stump line, defended solidly back to BOWLER END START0 START1 beauty, turning BATTER into an 'S'.

Driven to mid-off. 82mph/132kph END START0 START1 pressed out to mid-off from a length END START0 START1 back of a length, wide outside off, chopped into the covers via the bottom edge. 78mph to start, just a loosener? END START0 START1 hard length, defended to Parkinson at mid-on END START0 START1 very wide on the crease, very full, and Fakhar's firm drive is straight at Stokes, who fields at mid-off END START0 START1 fullish in the channel outside off, driven to short cover. 89mph/144kph - the quickest ball he's bowled today, I think END START0 START1 nipping away from a length, driven to short extra cover END START0 START1 length ball, defended with a straight bat towards Malan END START0 START1 length ball, driven to mid-on END START0 START1 BOWLER sticks a hand up in appeal, but clearly a thick inside-edge into the top of the pad. Height was an issue, too, from back of a length END START0 START1 back of a length, gets in line to defend down the pitch END START0 START1 angled in from wide on the crease, defended down the pitch from a length. 88mph/142kph END START0 START1 fullish length, defended back to BOWLER on the bounce who does his best to tip it back onto the stumps at the non-striker's end, but can't quite do so. Think Shakeel might have got his bat down in time, regardless END START0 START1 length ball at 81mph/130kph, defended firmly to mid-off END START0 START1 fullish length, defended to Stokes at mid-off END START0 START1 defended from a length with soft hands, BOWLER fields in his follow-through END START0 START1 full outswinger, bit of shape at 80mph/129kph, and Fakhar defends towards mid-off END START0 START1 angled across him, back of a length, and defended into the covers END START0 START1 length ball, clipped to square leg off the pad. 86mph/139kph END START0 START1 length ball, gets across to cover off stump again and defends towards cover point END START0 START1 back of a length, Fakhar defends back down the pitch on the back foot END START0 START1 gets in line, defending a fullish outswinger to mid-off END START0 START1 full and angled across him outside off stump.

BOWLER starts with a maiden END START0 START1 another loud shout for lbw, but clearly pitched outside leg. BOWLER was the lone voice going up for that. Scrambled seam, hitting the knee roll END START0 START1 defended solidly, back down the pitch from a good length END START0 START1 nipping away from the bat at 81mph, defended to mid-on END START0 START1 back of a length ball on the pad, nudged back to BOWLER 80mph, gentle pace END START0 START1 length ball, angled across him, defended back to BOWLER END START0 START1 shuffles across to steer out to point. 87mpj/141kph from BOWLER, skiddy bounce from a length END START0 START1 good late shape in on its way through to Simpson, as BATTER leaves on length END START0 START1 miscued to mid-on via the inside edge, as BOWLER hits a length in the off-stump channel ENDSTART0 START1 ha. Fullish in the fifth-stump channel, and BATTER has a big swing and miss, clearing his front leg and looking to hoick over mid-on. Stokes has a big chuckle at slip END START0 START1 back of a length close to off stump, dabs with an open face to backward point END START0 START1 flat one sliding on outside off, looks for the late dab but can't connect END START0 START1 ooh. This 39-over-old ball is still doing so much. Back of a length, angling into the corridor, and it climbs steeply while straightening off the deck to beat BATTER's defensive bat END START0 START1 tossed up slow on off stump, and Shaheen is slightly off balance as he clips to midwicket. Wanted to drive that straighter, towards long-on END START0 START1 full and flat on off stump, clipped to midwicket END START0 START1 back of a length, straightening close to off stump, makes room and dabs to short third man END START0 START1 looks for the slog-sweep but that ball was too full. Smacked it into his own boot, and it popped up briefly in the air but was in no danger of carrying to midwicket END START0 START1 length ball on off stump, stays in his crease and blocks it back to the bowler END START0 START1 back of a length on off stump, defended into the off side END START0 START1 length ball straightening in the corridor, past the attempted defensive shot. Didn't really get a stride forward END START0 START1 length ball angling in towards off stump, punched back to the bowler END START0 START1 flat one slanting away from off stump, not much turn, punched into the covers off the back foot END START0 START1 full now, on off stump, punched back to the bowler END START0 START1 tossed up on off stump, Shaheen's bat comes down at an angle on the forward defensive, and he squirts it out to backward point END START0 START1 bouncer close to off stump, doesn't get up all that high, and Shaheen manages to evade it by falling to the floor and keeping his upper body away from the line, keeping his eyes on the ball all through END START0 START1 full, angling in towards off stump, gets a nice stride into the ball again and drives to the right of mid-off, who moves quickly and forces Shakeel to turn around after haring out of his crease initially END START0 START1 back of a length on off stump, clipped towards midwicket END START0 START1 digs it in short now, and that angle from wide of the crease combined with Shaheen's height make this a difficult bouncer to evade, but he does it well, dropping to his knees and swaying his upper body away from the line END START0 START1 back of a length, angling in from wide of the crease and straightens off the seam in the corridor. Had to play at it, and it slides past his outside edge END START0 START1 back of a length close to off stump, defended towards midwicket END START0 START1 back of a length, angling in towards off stump from wide of the crease, defended into the on side END START0 START1 full, angling across and finishing on off stump, defended towards mid-on END START0 START1 back of a length on off stump, punched to mid-off END START0 START1 back of a length, slanting away from off stump, perhaps some away seam too. Not much footwork as he looks to punch away from his body, and he's beaten on the outside edge END START0 START1 back of a length, angling into off stump, lets it come on and defends to midwicket END START0 START1 shortish, extra bounce as it straightens in the corridor. Shaheen looks to punch it away with an angled bat and can't make contact. Looks like the keeper thought there might have been an edge on it. England have reviewed here... Nope, no bat whatsoever END START0 START1 short ball in the corridor, Shaheen leaves it alone END START0 START1 back of a length, fairly wide of off stump, left alone END START0 START1 short outside off, gets on top of the bounce and chops it down towards cover point END START0 START1 haha, that's a proper old-fashioned slog. Length ball in the corridor, and he clears his front leg and swipes across the line, failing to make any contact END START0 START1 shortish, slanting away outside off, looks to cut but can't connect END START0 START1 flatter to finish, into the off side to stem the flow. Just a small reminder that England need to finish off what they've started! Otherwise the rate is now down to 100 from 102 balls... END START0 START1 a revolting wipe across the line and so close to losing his off stump! END START0 START1 a flashing wipe through the line, no edge on that one END START0 START1 banged in short, through to the keeper END START0 START1 off come the bails as Simpson is in the game again! It's an enthusiastic appeal, but maybe a touch hopeful in tone... wide line, beats the edge... and yes, that toe has wriggled back into the crease END START0 START1 half an appeal, hit outside the line, and no interest there END START0 START1 blocked down the pitch once again, good probing areas END START0 START1 dipping on a full length END START0 START1 line and length, solid in defence and pressed down the pitch END START0 START1 up on the toes, punched back to the bowler END START0 START1 beauty. This one hits the seam on off stump and leaps past the outside edge END START0 START1 speared past the legs, and not called wide as BATTER walks inside the line and nearly loses his leg peg END START0 START1 through to the keeper, a half-formed push-drive greeting the good length outside off END START0 START1 fully forward, smothering the spin END START0 START1 shuffling back and across to close the door on an off-stump line END START0 START1 flicked to the on-side, on the front foot, probing areas from the leggie END START0 START1 pressed to the on-side once more, good areas from Parky END START0 START1 on the back foot, measured pull to the on-side, midwicket gathers END START0 START1 'good Parky, good Parky'. On the back foot, turned to the leg side END START0 START1 forward again, back to the bowler END START0 START1 lots of air outside off, 'love that Parky' says Simpson, who is a proper keeper with old-school inane chat END START0 START1 stretching forward, driven on the front foot, back to the bowler END START0 START1 back of a length, angled back into the pads, and worked to the on side END START0 START1 flatter line, outside off, cut hard to point END START0 START1 good flight and bite on the leg-break, drawing the batter forward to defend END START0 START1 wider line, back of a length again, and poked to the off side END START0 START1 up on the toes, pumped to cover END START0 START1 outside off, and jabbed to point END START0 START1 high-elbowed block, into the off side END START0 START1 firm in defence on the front foot END START0 START1 short again, sharp END START0 START1 worked into the off side, no way through there END START0 START1 good finish to an expensive over, hits the good length outside off, poked to point END START0 START1 back on a fuller length, angled in and pressed to cover END START0 START1 fenced with an open face into the cordon. Line and length END START0 START1 crashed hard into the covers, can't pierce the off-side ring END START0 START1 full length, eased into the covers off the back foot END START0 START1 banged in short, that gets up sharply as BATTER fends off his chest END START0 START1 line and length, solid block. A maiden over END START0 START1 poked with an open face to point END START0 START1 punched off the back foot, gathered in the covers END START0 START1 hitting the deck harder outside off, firm in defence from round the wicket END START0 START1 81mph/131kph, not quite a slower ball but loops onto a full length nonetheless, drawing a respectful block END START0 START1 round the wicket, probing on a good length at 83mph, tapped to the off side END START0 START1 fifth-stump line, lovely carry to the keeper. Wheels END START0 START1 wider on the crease, speared into the stumps, blocked into the off side END START0 START1 outside off, good carry on a wider line, no stroke offered END START0 START1 back of a length, hitting the seam at 84mph/134kph, and jabbed down into the pitch END START0 START1 full and straight, 85mph, in the blockhole and defended END START0 START1 length ball, angling into the corridor and straightening off the deck to beat Fakhar's forward defensive END START0 START1 length ball on off stump, defended to short midwicket END START0 START1 back of a length, seaming away to finish on off stump. Gets nicely behind it to defend into the covers END START0 START1 fullish, angling across to off stump, defended back to the bowler END START0 START1 back of a length, straightens into the body after pitching around leg stump. Misses the flick and is hit on the thigh pad END START0 START1 short, slanting away from off stump and offering some width, and Fakhar cuts it away hard but straight to cover point END START0 START1 fullish, angling across to off stump, good stride forward for the checked drive to mid-off END START0 START1 back of a length in the corridor, lets it come on and dabs to backward point with an open face END START0 START1 length ball in the corridor, good stride forward to block it back to the bowler END START0 START1 length ball close to off stump, defended to mid-off END START0 START1 fullish on off stump, lets it come on and squeezes it to point with an open face END START0 START1 length ball, angling into the corridor from around the wicket, presses forward and blocks into the covers END START0 START1 on the fuller side of a length, in the corridor, driven with an open face to point END START0 START1 back of a length, nipping in past the attempted back-foot defensive to smack into his midriff. Ouch END START0 START1 length ball seaming in from outside off, tight leave but he seems to judge it well enough END START0 START1 length ball, a bit of seam movement in to hit the pad again as Fakhar misses the flick. He doesn't move too much across his stumps, so an incoming ball hitting his pads in that manner is unlikely to get him lbw. Going down leg again. No appeal either END START0 START1 very full now, looking to target the stumps but probably drifting down leg as Fakhar misses the flick and is hit on the pad END START0 START1 back of a length on off stump, blocked back to the bowler END START0 START1 fullish, angling into the fourth-stump channel, presses forward and blocks it back to the bowler END START0 START1 a hint of width this time and he stands tall to punch, but he hits it straight to backward point. He'll feel he missed out there END START0 START1 short, but angling into the corridor and denying Fakhar the width he so craves. Gets on top of the bounce and chops it down to backward point END START0 START1 ooh. Goes wide of the crease, angles it into the corridor, hits a good length hard, and gets it to straighten. The angle forces BATTER to play a defensive shot, and the movement beats his outside edge END START0 START1 back of a length, angling across and then seaming away further after pitching on or around off stump. BATTER looks to defend off the back foot and is beaten comfortably END START0 START1 length ball on off stump, defended back down the pitch END START0 START1 back of a length, a bit of inward movement to deny Fakhar room, defended towards mid-off END START0 START1 length ball, nips in with extra bounce from outside off as Fakhar defends without too much of a stride. Past the inside edge and into thigh pad END START0 START1 full, angling into off stump and straightening away. Shapes to play into the on side, then adjusts in a hurry and defends to mid-off, squirting it off the outside half of the bat END START0 START1 shortish, not enough width to cut, chops it down into the gully region END START0 START1 back of a length, a lot of seam movement away plus a lot of bounce, but it starts wide enough for BATTER to leave without too much bother END START0 START1 a little fuller, but similar line and movement. BATTER looks for a firm drive down the ground, and gets a thick inside edge to midwicket END START0 START1 ooh, sharp inward movement from outside off. BATTER, batting with his head well outside the line of off stump, looks to punch down the ground, and the ball beats his inside edge END START0 START1 full, angling across to middle and off, defended back to the bowler END START0 START1 length ball seaming away after pitching on off stump, left alone END START0 START1 back of a length, fairly wide of off stump, left alone END START0 START1 back of a length in the corridor, nips in a touch. Judges it well from his perch almost outside off stump, and leaves it alone END START0 START1 big shuffle across again and BOWLER attacks his stumps. Brings his bat down at an angle to clip to midwicket END START0 START1 fullish outside off, and BATTER, batting outside his crease and getting a long way forward and across, defends into the covers END START0 START1 back of a length in the corridor and it leaps up off the pitch while leaving the right-hander. Half-plays, half-leaves, and doesn't get his bat anywhere near it END START0 START1 ooh. Fullish, and it seems to swing in late towards off stump before pitching and seaming the other way. Unplayable. Looks to drive down the ground and it zips past his outside edge END START0 START1 back of a length, straightening towards off stump, punched towards mid-off, who sprints quickly forward to deny the single END START0 START1 shortish ball rising high over off stump, straightening a touch on Fakhar. Doesn't move his feet a great deal, but somehow manages to get on top of the ball effortlessly and block it down into the leg side END START0 START1 length ball angling in towards off stump, presses forward and blocks into the covers END START0 START1 length ball in the corridor, left alone END START0 START1 down the track to the ball floated away from off stump, and he gets to the pitch and drives powerfully, but he can't beat mid-off END START0 START1 back of a length in the corridor, squares up a little but manages to defend it safely enough into the point region END START0 START1 ooh, that went like an offbreak. Definite offcutter action as he delivered it, landing it quite full outside off stump and tempting Babar to drive. Goes after it, and the ball beats his inside edge END START0 START1 short and wide this time, and Babar reaches out to cut but mistimes it, chops it down towards the slip cordon END START0 START1 back of a length, fifth-stump channel, left alone END START0 START1 back of a length, nips in towards off stump, defended into the covers END START0 START1 full on off stump, punched to mid-off END START0 START1 length ball angling across and straightening towards off stump, clipped to square leg END START0 START1 wow. Back of a length, angling in towards off stump from wide of the crease, and then it seams away prodigiously before swinging away even further. Squares Babar up in defence, but he ensures his bat stays close to his body and lets himself get beaten END START0 START1 fullish in the fifth-stump channel, left alone END START0 START1 back of a length, this one seams away from off stump, not much footwork, pokes at it and the ball beats his outside edge END START0 START1 back of a length, pitching outside leg and straightening to finish over the top of middle stump or so. Looks to work it into the leg side, and it's past his inside edge to hit thigh pad END START0 START1 full, down the leg side. Misses the flick and is hit on the pad END START0 START1 length ball angling across to off stump, straightens a touch. Shows the full face and defends it back to the bowler END START0 START1 back of a length on leg stump, a bit of extra bounce. Looks to play across it, as opposed to Imam who played a similar ball with a straight bat. Misses, and is hit on the thigh pad END START0 START1 banged in short, looping through to the keeper as Saqib looks appealingly for the wide END START0 START1 onto the front dog, pumped to mid-on END START0 START1 Rauf has got the reverse going nicely, at 87mph this time, but the line is awry. Thudding the pads again END START0 START1 another yorker, and how has he squeezed that out! Bat and bat combine to resist the inswinger. Hasan is denied his five-for by a whisker! END START0 START1 solid in defence as the ball bites the deck and seams into a firm block END START0 START1 a wild wipe, and no idea how that missed! Another donking drive, but the slower ball dips through the swing, and just past the off stump END START0 START1 short, ducked END START0 START1 outside off, a wafty wristy nothing shot, misses everything END START0 START1 Bashed to mid-on and dropped! Saqib clears the front dog and belts clean through the line. Faheem lets it flop through his fingers END START0 START1 back of a length, shaping in, ghosts past the outside edge at 90mph/145kph END START0 START1 closes the face on a push to the leg side. Five overs remaining. Bat the overs lads? END START0 START1 beats the edge from back of a length, a hopeful appeal... all sorts of talk of a review... and at the last split-second they go for it Nope, nothing END START0 START1 line and length, firm in defence into the off side END START0 START1 nip off the seam again, there's been plenty of it today, thumped on the thigh-pad, from a full length END START0 START1 full length, attacking the off stump, fenced to cover END START0 START1 outside off, back of a length, watched through to the keeper END START0 START1 firmly onto the front foot, driven hard but short cover gathers END START0 START1 a windy whoosh, outside off so there for the shot, but misses everything END START0 START1 firmly forward, blocked to the off side END START0 START1 dragged out of the crease, nowhere near the pitch, and does well to check his stroke and block END START0 START1 solidly forward, firm in defence END START0 START1 full length, angled into the stumps, pushed to the off side END START0 START1 tight line, just back of a length, shape back into the right-hander, and fenced down into the crease END START0 START1 on the back foot, better line, firm in defence END START0 START1 on the back foot, blocked down into the crease END START0 START1 coming forward this time, pressed to the off side END START0 START1 nearly! Lovely line and length, hits the seam, jags into an aggressive back-foot push, and almost wriggles into the stumps END START0 START1 over-pitched on the toes, right up to the pads but midwicket tidies up END START0 START1 beaten, lovely line, angled across a defensive stance, and just missing the edge END START0 START1 flashed into the covers, and quickly intercepted END START0 START1 high-elbowed drive, into the covers END START0 START1 feet stuck in the crease as BOWLER finds some more nip from a good length, back into the bat END START0 START1 beautiful line, back over the wicket, and hopping past the edge as BATTER presses down the pitch END START0 START1 very full, driven past a leaping short cover, on the front foot END START0 START1 bouncer, BATTER ducks as the left-arm-over line hustles his helmet END START0 START1 huge appeal from Shaheen! But that seemed to miss everything as it jagged past the edge, angled across on such a tight line END START0 START1 crunched into the covers, firm strike on a full length, intercepted END START0 START1 huge nipbacker! BATTER is cut in half as the ball jags down the slope. A snick as it clips the top of the pad, but eludes the inside edge END START0 START1 signs of width encourage BATTER to throw his hands at the shot, but that jags back sharply to confound his intentions END START0 START1 onto the front foot, pressed to mid-off, meeting the tight line END START0 START1 full and straight, watchful in defence END START0 START1  END START0 START1 rising on the back foot, thumped to cover END START0 START1 dragged down leg-break, cracked off the back foot but straight at midwicket END START0 START1 tossed up, on the pads, forward to block END START0 START1 length ball angling in towards off stump, stays back and defends to extra-cover END START0 START1 similar delivery, but quicker, and bat and pad are close together as he defends this into the off side END START0 START1 length ball, skids on straight towards off stump, keeps his front pad away from the line and defends to short extra-cover END START0 START1 tossed up, a bit closer to off stump, driven to short extra-cover END START0 START1 short, rising ball on off stump. Hops to ride the bounce and play it down into the pitch with soft hands END START0 START1 length ball on off stump, stays back and blocks it back to the bowler END START0 START1 yorker outside off, opens his bat face and squeezes it to backward point END START0 START1 another flighted full-toss, clipped to mid-on from outside off stump END START0 START1 full, closer to off stump, clipped to midwicket END START0 START1 tossed up, wrong'un, spinning away from off stump, defended to short extra-cover END START0 START1 shortish, at the hip, looks to work it away and only manages a bit of thigh pad down to the keeper. Looks for a nervy leg bye without realising how close it is to Rizwan, and hurriedly backtracks to make his ground END START0 START1 bouncer, angling into the body, steps across and looks to hook, but is a touch late on the shot. Rizwan makes a polite appeal for caught behind, but that didn't hit anything END START0 START1 length ball close to off stump, lets it come on and defends with soft hands into the point region END START0 START1 length ball angling into off stump, defended towards mid-on END START0 START1 full, just outside off, driven to mid-off END START0 START1 a touch leg-sidish, swept to backward square leg END START0 START1 tossed up slow, pitching on middle and turning away from the left-hander. Doesn't pick it, looks to work it leg side, and gets a leading edge that rolls towards mid-off END START0 START1 back of a length in the corridor, and BATTER is beaten looking to make room and dab to third man with an open face END START0 START1 length ball angling into the stumps, defended into the on side END START0 START1 digs it in short again, and there's a quiet half-appeal from Rizwan after BATTER ducks under it. Clipped his right bicep on its way to the keeper END START0 START1 bouncer rising over off stump, BATTER ducks underneath END START0 START1 full again, on middle and leg, looking to deny BATTER room to free his arms. Clipped to midwicket END START0 START1 full, pitching on middle and leg, picks the wrong'un and drives to mid-off END START0 START1 nice length, straightening into middle stump, defended back down the pitch END START0 START1 full, angling into the corridor, driven off the front foot to mid-off END START0 START1 shortish, wide of off stump, left alone END START0 START1 length ball close to off stump, stays on the back foot and defends into the covers END START0 START1 wrong'un to start, on the shorter side, and BATTER, looking to go back and work it into the leg side, is beaten and hit on the thigh pad END START0 START1 similar line, but quicker, and BATTER drives to short extra-cover END START0 START1 legbreak now, wider outside off, beats the outside edge as BATTER thrashes at it with an angled bat, looking to hit through the covers END START0 START1 another googly, quicker this time. Gets half-forward to push down the ground, and is beaten on the inside edge. Hits the pad but it's sliding down leg END START0 START1 wrong'un, nicely flighted, not picked at all. Wants to drive to long-off, ends up inside-edging to midwicket END START0 START1 full on middle and leg, looks to drive to long-on but the bowler moves quickly to his left to intercept END START0 START1 a bit fuller but flat and quick again, slanting across to off stump, defended back to the bowler END START0 START1 fired across the left-hander towards off stump, not much turn, keeps a bit low. Jabbed back to the bowler END START0 START1 full, close to off stump, driven wristily to extra-cover END START0 START1 short, wide, and BOWLER gets away with it. Snatches at his cut too early and hits it to extra-cover END START0 START1 goes back to this one straightening into him and cramping him for room.

Perhaps not short enough to cut, and BATTER doesn't really move his feet there, just uses his hands to try and steer it away, and it pitches and turns sharply past the outside edge END START0 START1 similar delivery, skidding legbreak around off stump without too much turn, chopped to backward point END START0 START1 length ball outside off, stays back and jabs towards backward point END START0 START1 wrong'un, goes back to try and push through the off side, doesn't pick it. Thick outside edge, hits the keeper's right pad and rolls to backward point END START0 START1 full outside off, too full to drive through the covers. Jabbed back to the bowler with a turn of the wrists END START0 START1 on the back foot, tucked to the leg side END START0 START1 flat-footed flash, outside off, fifth-stump line, and no contact END START0 START1 back of a length, tapped to point, and BATTER is sent back in a scurry!

END START0 START1 short and wide, climbs into a cut, and misses out END START0 START1 vertical blade, punched off the back foot to point END START0 START1 right behind the line this time to defend with sturdy wrists back to the bowler END START0 START1 tighter line, back of a length, BATTER has another big wind-up but can't get this one away, as the bowler gathers END START0 START1 blocked on the back foot, fuller face of the bat END START0 START1 hint of away swing, just back of a length.

END START0 START1 aggressive pacy delivery, attacking the stumps from the outset at 140kph END START0 START1 back of a length, blocked on off-stump END START0 START1 lovely yorker! Looked like an inside-edge on a wild swipe, no threat of a wicket, but no hope of connecting properly either END START0 START1 cracked on the front foot, very wide line, connects with a toe-ended drive to cover END START0 START1 squared up on the back foot, squeezed off the splice into the covers END START0 START1 flashy outside off, and nip off the seam down the slope. BATTER flings his bat into the ether, and can't connect END START0 START1 fuller length, pushed right up outside off, and thumped with a closed face once more to the on-side END START0 START1 fenced to the on-side, slightly closed face on impact END START0 START1 flashed into the covers END START0 START1 huge appeal for an under-edged pull, and up goes the finger! BATTER reviews immediately, but Pakistan were adamant... a big heave and a pirouette, as Shaheen banged it in back of a length. But no bat involved! Gosh, umpire Illingworth looks nonplussed as he overturns his decision. He wasn't the only one who heard something END START0 START1 very full length, BATTER leans into the drive but scuffs his shot into the off side END START0 START1 shaping away from BATTER this time, nip away from the edge as he holds the bat inside the line END START0 START1 nipping back into the left-hander's knee-roll, back down the slope and bouncing over the top of middle as it flicks the pad-flap END START0 START1 Inside edge, very close to leg stump! Standing tall on the back foot, and some extra nip off the seam hustles the defensive push END START0 START1 fuller length, shaped towards the cordon, flowing drive to point END START0 START1 back of a length, tight line, inside-edged defence down into the crease. That's a lively over of cut and thrust END START0 START1 booming drive, and misses! Pushed across on a wider line, and a flat-footed yahoo, aimed into the covers END START0 START1 good leave, shaped across the right-hander, who lets it pass on length over the top of off. He was found out chasing that angle in the first match END START0 START1 pushed onto the back foot, leg-stump line, nudged to the on-side ENDSTART0 START1 onto the front foot, punched to cover END START0 START1 a wild wipe! Outside the stumps, so BATTER reckons that's fair game, but late movement nearly takes out his timbers END START0 START1 flicked to the leg side, a violent return to the keeper gives Sarfaraz some work to do END START0 START1 solid in defence END START0 START1 a stride to the pitch, solid block back to the bowler. Now then... END START0 START1 beaten outside off! Now things get squeaky! Stuck on the crease, lift off the deck, nearly the nick! END START0 START1 firmly forward, punched to the off side, and that hung in the air too, but Babar is too deep to make it a catch END START0 START1 fuller length, he was waiting for that one, but his clobbered drive is gathered at mid-off on the bounce END START0 START1 yorker, excellent delivery, speared in on the angle, well dug out END START0 START1 so nearly done him in! Outstanding slower ball, tailing in late, completely foxing BATTER, and that wriggles over middle! Yikes. BATTER grins as well he might END START0 START1 punched back to the bowler END START0 START1 short and wide outside off, the slash through the covers is on, but BATTER misses out. Close to a thin nick there! END START0 START1 angled bat on the full length, squeezed to short third man... there's an accurate shy to the keeper so they are checking the run out... nope, nothing there END START0 START1 on the back foot, flicked to the on-side, no way through there END START0 START1 fires in the yorker, well dug out. But another over of progress for England END START0 START1 so nearly holed out! And again, mid-on is fractionally too deep to be in the game!

Now then, can Pakistan finish this over well...? END START0 START1 a gallop to the pitch, another slower ball sticks in the pitch and hops over the stumps! Careful now... END START0 START1 slower ball, BATTER's turn to check his drive as he lines up the lump through the covers END START0 START1 on the back foot, tucked to the on-side. This is a tight over so far... END START0 START1 oof, went for the rasping pull, and nearly lost the top of middle! Through it too soon, as that skims the bails END START0 START1 pushed back down the pitch END START0 START1 flogged off a good length, solid connection but straight at mid-on... 97 needed now END START0 START1 probing length, very full on middle and leg, BATTER closes the gate to block it back to the bowler END START0 START1 better ball, bending in on a full length, solid forward defence to see it off END START0 START1 nudged into the leg side END START0 START1 squared up on the back foot, poked to cover END START0 START1 clears his front leg for the drive, but settles for a closed-face push back to the bowler. Line too tight to free the arms END START0 START1 punched into the covers, hit hard but straight at the man END START0 START1 full length, swinging away on an off-stump line, poked to point END START0 START1 inside edge that only just fails to clip off stump.

Good comeback this over END START0 START1 pushed into the offside, but the single's not on END START0 START1 defended END START0 START1 pushes out of his crease and defends END START0 START1 driven to midwicket END START0 START1 Dot ball to round it out but that's an okay over for England.

His Islamabad United teammate was beaten all ends up END START0 START1 another dot ball. Quiet over, this, and now England have gone two overs without a boundary on the trot. I believe every over prior had seen at least one go to the fence END START0 START1 crisply struck drive, but the man at cover does well to stop it in its tracks END START0 START1 pace off the ball, and BATTER defends.

It had four written all over it if not for the fact it thundered into poor Vincy, who was knocked down with the force of the shot END START0 START1 a bit of confusion, with BATTER turned back by Stokes. Frustrating over for BOWLER END START0 START1 straightens towards BATTER, defended END START0 START1 punched to cover, and that will be drinks END START0 START1 on the legs, nudged to the on-side, can't find the gap at mid-on END START0 START1 firm and blocked to the off side END START0 START1 hard to backward point, can't get through there END START0 START1 right in behind the line on the back foot to defend END START0 START1 outside off, through to the keeper on a fifth-stump line.

It's ragged out there END START0 START1 punched on the front foot again END START0 START1 pressed into the covers on the front foot END START0 START1 whoosh! Banged in short, BATTER swings into a pull, misses everything, and gets a word in his shell from the bowler for his efforts.

Misses out on the full toss END START0 START1 takes the pace off and beats BATTER all ends up END START0 START1 commits to the bouncer this time and BATTER fails to deal with the extra bounce END START0 START1 excellent bouncer. BATTER was advancing and he drops the ball short. BATTER was looking for another wide, but the umpire wouldn't oblige END START0 START1 full onto the pads. BATTER is annoyed he didn't lap it over fine leg for six. Absolute stinker of a ball, and he even gets away with the wide call, does Saqib END START0 START1 good start, wide yorker that. Babar was making room for himself and could do little about it END
